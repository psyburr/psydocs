NAME

   fd - find entries in the filesystem

SYNOPSIS

   fd [-HIEsiaLp0hV] [-d depth] [-t filetype] [-e ext] [-E exclude] [-c when] [-j num] [-x cmd] [pattern] [path...]

DESCRIPTION

   fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find(1).

OPTIONS

   -H, --hidden

   Include hidden files and directories in the search results (default: hidden files and directories are skipped).

   -I, --no-ignore

   Show search results from files and directories that would otherwise be ignored by .gitignore, .ignore, .fdignore, or the global ignore file.

   -u, --unrestricted

   Alias for '--no-ignore'. Can be repeated; '-uu' is an alias for '--no-ignore --hidden'.

   --no-ignore-vcs

   Show search results from files and directories that would otherwise be ignored by .gitignore files.

   -s, --case-sensitive

   Perform a case-sensitive search. By default, fd uses case-insensitive searches, unless the pattern contains an uppercase character (smart case).

   -i, --ignore-case

   Perform a case-insensitive search. By default, fd uses case-insensitive searches, unless the pattern contains an uppercase character (smart case).

   -g, --glob

   Perform a glob-based search instead of a regular expression search.

   --regex

   Perform a regular-expression based search (default). This can be used to override --glob.

   -F, --fixed-strings

   Treat the pattern as a literal string instead of a regular expression. Note that this also performs substring comparison. If you want to match on an exact filename, consider using '--glob'.

   -a, --absolute-path

   Shows the full path starting from the root as opposed to relative paths.

   -l, --list-details

   Use a detailed listing format like 'ls -l'. This is basically an alias for '--exec-batch ls -l' with some additional 'ls' options. This can be used to see more metadata, to show symlink targets and to achieve a deterministic sort
   order.

   -L, --follow

   By default, fd does not descend into symlinked directories. Using this flag, symbolic links are also traversed.

   -p, --full-path

   By default, the search pattern is only matched against the filename (or directory name). Using this flag, the pattern is matched against the full path.

   -0, --print0

   Separate search results by the null character (instead of newlines). Useful for piping results to xargs.

   --max-results count

   Limit the number of search results to 'count' and quit immediately.

   -1

   Limit the search to a single result and quit immediately. This is an alias for '--max-results=1'.

   --show-errors

   Enable the display of filesystem errors for situations such as insufficient permissions or dead symlinks.

   --one-file-system, --mount, --xdev

   By default, fd will traverse the file system tree as far as other options dictate. With this flag, fd ensures that it does not descend into a different file system than the one it started in. Comparable to the -mount or -xdev
   filters of find(1).

   -h, --help

   Print help information.

   -V, --version

   Print version information.

   -d, --max-depth d

   Limit directory traversal to at most d levels of depth. By default, there is no limit on the search depth.

   --min-depth d

   Only show search results starting at the given depth. See also: '--max-depth' and '--exact-depth'.

   --exact-depth d

   Only show search results at the exact given depth. This is an alias for '--min-depth <depth> --max-depth <depth>'.

   --prune

   Do not traverse into matching directories.

   -t, --type filetype

   Filter search by type:
   f, file

   regular files

   d, directory

   directories

   l, symlink

   symbolic links

   x, executable

   executable (files)

   e, empty

   empty files or directories

   s, socket

   sockets

   p, pipe

   named pipes (FIFOs)

   This option can be used repeatedly to allow for multiple file types.

   -e, --extension ext

   Filter search results by file extension ext. This option can be used repeatedly to allow for multiple possible file extensions.

   If you want to search for files without extension, you can use the regex '^[^.]+$' as a normal search pattern.

   -E, --exclude pattern

   Exclude files/directories that match the given glob pattern. This overrides any other ignore logic. Multiple exclude patterns can be specified. Examples:
   --exclude '*.pyc'
   --exclude node_modules

   --ignore-file path

   Add a custom ignore-file in '.gitignore' format. These files have a low precedence.

   -c, --color when

   Declare when to colorize search results:

   auto

   Colorize output when standard output is connected to terminal (default).

   never

   Do not colorize output.

   always

   Always colorize output.

   -j, --threads num

   Set number of threads to use for searching & executing (default: number of available CPU cores).

   -S, --size size

   Limit results based on the size of files using the format <+-><NUM><UNIT>

   '+'

   file size must be greater than or equal to this

   '-'

   file size must be less than or equal to this

   If neither '+' nor '-' is specified, file size must be exactly equal to this.

   'NUM'

   The numeric size (e.g. 500)

   'UNIT'

   The units for NUM. They are not case-sensitive. Allowed unit values:

   'b'

   bytes

   'k'

   kilobytes (base ten, 10^3 = 1000 bytes)

   'm'

   megabytes

   'g'

   gigabytes

   't'

   terabytes

   'ki'

   kibibytes (base two, 2^10 = 1024 bytes)

   'mi'

   mebibytes

   'gi'

   gibibytes

   'ti'

   tebibytes

   --changed-within date|duration

   Filter results based on the file modification time. The argument can be provided as a specific point in time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) or as a duration (10h, 1d, 35min). --change-newer-than can be used as an alias.

   Examples:
   --changed-within 2weeks
   --change-newer-than "2018-10-27 10:00:00"

   --changed-before date|duration

   Filter results based on the file modification time. The argument can be provided as a specific point in time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) or as a duration (10h, 1d, 35min). --change-older-than can be used as an alias.

   Examples:
   --changed-before "2018-10-27 10:00:00"
   --change-older-than 2weeks

   -o, --owner [user][:group]

   Filter files by their user and/or group. Format: [(user|uid)][:(group|gid)]. Either side is optional. Precede either side with a '!' to exclude files instead.

   Examples:
   --owner john
   --owner :students
   --owner "!john:students"

   --base-directory path

   Change the current working directory of fd to the provided path. This means that search results will be shown with respect to the given base path. Note that relative paths which are passed to fd via the positional path argument or
   the --search-path option will also be resolved relative to this directory.

   --path-separator separator

   Set the path separator to use when printinf file paths. The default is the OS-specific separator ('/' on Unix, '\' on Windows).

   --search-path search-path

   Provide paths to search as an alternative to the positional path argument. Changes the usage to ´fd [FLAGS/OPTIONS] --search-path PATH --search-path PATH2 [PATTERN]´

   -x, --exec command

   Execute command for each search result. The following placeholders are substituted by a path derived from the current search result:

   {}

   path

   {/}

   basename

   {//}

   parent directory

   {.}

   path without file extension

   {/.}

   basename without file extension

   -X, --exec-batch command

   Execute command with all search results at once. A single occurence of the following placeholders is authorized and substituted by the paths derived from the search results before the command is executed:

   {}

   path

   {/}

   basename

   {//}

   parent directory

   {.}

   path without file extension

   {/.}

   basename without file extension

PATTERN SYNTAX

   The regular expression syntax used by fd is documented here:

   https://docs.rs/regex/1.0.0/regex/#syntax

   The glob syntax is documented here:

   https://docs.rs/globset/#syntax

ENVIRONMENT

   LS_COLORS

   Determines how to colorize search results, see dircolors(1).

   NO_COLOR

   Disables colorized output.

   XDG_CONFIG_HOME, HOME

   Used to locate the global ignore file. If XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set, use $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fd/ignore. Otherwise, use $HOME/.config/fd/ignore.

EXAMPLES

   Find files and directories that match the pattern 'needle':

   $ fd needle

   Start a search in a given directory (/var/log):

   $ fd nginx /var/log

   Find all Python files (all files with the extention .py) in the current
   directory:

   $ fd -e py

   Open all search results with vim:

   $ fd pattern -X vim
