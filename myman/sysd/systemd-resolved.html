      This API is widely supported, including beyond the Linux platform. In its current form it does not
      expose DNSSEC validation status information however, and is synchronous only. This API is backed by the

      (<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/nss.5.html"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">nss</span>(5)</span></a>).

      <a href="nss-resolve.html#"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">nss-resolve</span>(8)</span></a> is

      <span class="command"><strong>systemd-resolved</strong></span>. Note however that it is strongly recommended that local programs
      use the glibc NSS or bus APIs instead (as described above), as various network resolution concepts

      network and a reply is sent immediately.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Single-label names are resolved using LLMNR on all local interfaces where LLMNR is
      enabled. Lookups for IPv4 addresses are only sent via LLMNR on IPv4, and lookups for IPv6 addresses are
      only sent via LLMNR on IPv6. Note that lookups for single-label synthesized names are not routed to
      LLMNR, MulticastDNS or unicast DNS.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Queries for the address records (A and AAAA) of single-label non-synthesized names are
      resolved via unicast DNS using search domains. For any interface which defines search domains, such
      look-ups are routed to the servers defined for that interface, suffixed with each of those search
      domains. When global search domains are defined, such look-ups are routed to the global servers. For
      each search domain, queries are performed by suffixing the name with each of the search domains in
      turn. Additionally, lookup of single-label names via unicast DNS may be enabled with the
      <code class="varname">ResolveUnicastSingleLabel=yes</code> setting. The details of which servers are queried and
      how the final reply is chosen are described below. Note that this means that address queries for
      single-label names are never sent out to remote DNS servers by default, and resolution is only
      possible if search domains are defined.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Multi-label names with the domain suffix "<code class="literal">.local</code>" are resolved using
      MulticastDNS on all local interfaces where MulticastDNS is enabled. As with LLMNR, IPv4 address lookups
      are sent via IPv4 and IPv6 address lookups are sent via IPv6.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Queries for multi-label names are routed via unicast DNS on local interfaces that have
      a DNS server configured, plus the globally configured DNS servers if there are any. Which interfaces
      are used is determined by the routing logic based on search and route-only domains, described below.
      Note that by default, lookups for domains with the "<code class="literal">.local</code>" suffix are not routed to
      DNS servers, unless the domain is specified explicitly as routing or search domain for the DNS server
      and interface. This means that on networks where the "<code class="literal">.local</code>" domain is defined in a
      site-specific DNS server, explicit search or routing domains need to be configured to make lookups work
      within this DNS domain. Note that these days, it's generally recommended to avoid defining
      "<code class="literal">.local</code>" in a DNS server, as <a class="ulink" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762" target="_top">RFC6762</a> reserves this domain for exclusive
      MulticastDNS use.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Address lookups (reverse lookups) are routed similarly to multi-label names, with the

      configured routing domains (search or route-only) of any link, or the globally configured DNS settings,
      "best matching" routing domain is determined: the matching one with the most labels. The query is then
      sent to all DNS servers of any links or the globally configured DNS servers associated with this "best
      matching" routing domain. (Note that more than one link might have this same "best matching" routing
      domain configured, in which case the query is sent to all of them in parallel).</p><p>In case of single-label names, when search domains are defined, the same logic applies, except
      that the name is first suffixed by each of the search domains in turn. Note that this search logic
      doesn't apply to any names with at least one dot. Also see the discussion about compatibility with
      the traditional glibc resolver below.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If a query does not match any configured routing domain (either per-link or global), it

    "<code class="literal">~.</code>", it defaults to false, otherwise to true.</p><p>Effectively this means: in order to support single-label non-synthesized names, define appropriate
    search domains. In order to preferably route all DNS queries not explicitly matched by routing domain
    configuration to a specific link, configure a "<code class="literal">~.</code>" route-only domain on it. This will
    ensure that other links will not be considered for these queries (unless they too carry such a routing
    domain). In order to route all such DNS queries to a specific link only if no other link is preferred,
    set the <code class="varname">DefaultRoute=</code> option for the link to true and do not configure a
    "<code class="literal">~.</code>" route-only domain on it. Finally, in order to ensure that a specific link never
    receives any DNS traffic not matching any of its configured routing domains, set the

        <span class="command"><strong>systemd-resolved</strong></span> is equivalent to the <span class="command"><strong>resolvectl
        reset-server-features</strong></span> command, however the latter is recommended since it operates in a
        synchronous way.</p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="id-1.11"></a><h2 id="See Also">See Also<a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this headline" href="systemd-resolved.html#See%20Also">¶</a></h2><p>

      1500 top-level domain names defined, and new ones are added regularly, often using "attractive" names
      that are also likely to be used locally. Not looking up multi-label names in this fashion avoids
      fragility in both directions: a valid global name could be obscured by a local name, and resolution of
      a relative local name could suddenly break when a new top-level domain is created, or when a new
      subdomain of a top-level domain in registered. Resolving any given name as either relative or absolute
      avoids this ambiguity.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
