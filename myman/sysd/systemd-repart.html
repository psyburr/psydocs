    configuration files described in
    <a href="repart.d.html#"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">repart.d</span>(5)</span></a>.
    </p><p>If invoked with no arguments, it operates on the block device backing the root file system
    partition of the running OS, thus growing and adding partitions of the booted OS image itself. If
    <code class="varname">--image=</code> is used it will operate on the specified image file. When called in the
    "<code class="literal">initrd</code>" it operates on the block device backing <code class="filename">/sysroot/</code> instead,
    i.e. on the block device the system will soon transition into. The
    <code class="filename">systemd-repart.service</code> service is generally run at boot in the initial RAM disk, in
    order to augment the partition table of the OS before its partitions are
    mounted. <span class="command"><strong>systemd-repart</strong></span> (mostly) operates in a purely incremental mode: it only grows
    existing and adds new partitions; it does not shrink, delete or move existing partitions. The service is
    intended to be run on every boot, but when it detects that the partition table already matches the
    installed <code class="filename">repart.d/*.conf</code> configuration files, it executes no operation.</p><p><span class="command"><strong>systemd-repart</strong></span> is intended to be used when deploying OS images, to automatically
    adjust them to the system they are running on, during first boot. This way the deployed image can be
    minimal in size and may be augmented automatically at boot when needed, taking possession of disk space
    available but not yet used. Specifically the following use cases are among those covered:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>The root partition may be grown to cover the whole available disk space.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A <code class="filename">/home/</code>, swap or <code class="filename">/srv/</code> partition can be
      added.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A second (or third, …) root partition may be added, to cover A/B style setups
      where a second version of the root file system is alternatingly used for implementing update
      schemes. The deployed image would carry only a single partition ("A") but on first boot a second
      partition ("B") for this purpose is automatically created.</p></li></ul></div><p>The algorithm executed by <span class="command"><strong>systemd-repart</strong></span> is roughly as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>The <code class="filename">repart.d/*.conf</code> configuration files are loaded and parsed,
      and ordered by filename (without the directory prefix).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The partition table already existing on the block device is loaded and
      parsed.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The existing partitions in the partition table are matched up with the
      <code class="filename">repart.d/*.conf</code> files by GPT partition type UUID. The first existing partition
      of a specific type is assigned the first configuration file declaring the same type. The second
      existing partition of a specific type is then assigned the second configuration file declaring the same
      type, and so on. After this iterative assigning is complete any left-over existing partitions that have
      no matching configuration file are considered "foreign" and left as they are. And any configuration
      files for which no partition currently exists are understood as a request to create such a
      partition.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Taking the size constraints and weights declared in the configuration files into
      account, all partitions that shall be created are now allocated to the disk, taking up all free space,
      always respecting the size and padding requests. Similar, existing partitions that are determined to
      grow are grown. New partitions are always appended to the end of the existing partition table, taking
      the first partition table slot whose index is greater than the indexes of all existing
      partitions. Partition table slots are never reordered and thus partition numbers are ensured to remain
      stable. Note that this allocation happens in RAM only, the partition table on disk is not updated
      yet.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>All existing partitions for which configuration files exist and which currently have no
      GPT partition label set will be assigned a label, either explicitly configured in the configuration or
      (if that's missing) derived automatically from the partition type. The same is done for all partitions
      that are newly created. These assignments are done in RAM only, too, the disk is not updated
      yet.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Similarly, all existing partitions for which configuration files exist and which
      currently have an all-zero identifying UUID will be assigned a new UUID. This UUID is cryptographically
      hashed from a common seed value together with the partition type UUID (and a counter in case multiple
      partitions of the same type are defined), see below. The same is done for all partitions that are
      created anew. These assignments are done in RAM only, too, the disk is not updated
      yet.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Similarly, if the disk's volume UUID is all zeroes it is also initialized, also
      cryptographically hashed from the same common seed value. Also, in RAM only, too.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The disk space assigned to new partitions (i.e. what was previously considered free
      space but is no longer) is now erased. Specifically, all file system signatures are removed, and if the
      device supports it the <code class="constant">BLKDISCARD</code> I/O control command is issued to inform the
      hardware that the space is empty now. In addition any "padding" between partitions and at the end of
      the device is similarly erased.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The new partition table is finally written to disk. The kernel is asked to reread the
      partition table.</p></li></ol></div><p>As exception to the normally strictly incremental operation, when called in a special "factory
    reset" mode, <span class="command"><strong>systemd-repart</strong></span> may also be used to erase existing partitions to
    reset an installation back to vendor defaults. This mode of operation is used when either the
    <code class="option">--factory-reset=yes</code> switch is passed on the tool's command line, or the
    <code class="option">systemd.factory_reset=yes</code> option specified on the kernel command line, or the
    <code class="varname">FactoryReset</code> EFI variable (vendor UUID
    <code class="constant">8cf2644b-4b0b-428f-9387-6d876050dc67</code>) is set to "yes". It alters the algorithm above
    slightly: between the 3rd and the 4th step above any partition marked explicitly via the
    <code class="varname">FactoryReset=</code> boolean is deleted, and the algorithm restarted, thus immediately
    re-creating these partitions anew empty.</p><p>Note that <span class="command"><strong>systemd-repart</strong></span> only changes partition tables, it does not create or
    resize any file systems within these partitions. A separate mechanism should be used for that, for
    example
    <a href="systemd-growfs.html#"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">systemd-growfs</span>(8)</span></a> and
    <span class="command"><strong>systemd-makefs</strong></span>.</p><p>The UUIDs identifying the new partitions created (or assigned to existing partitions that have no
    UUID yet), as well as the disk as a whole are hashed cryptographically from a common seed value. This
    seed value is usually the
    <a href="machine-id.html#"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">machine-id</span>(5)</span></a> of the
    system, so that the machine ID reproducibly determines the UUIDs assigned to all partitions. If the
    machine ID cannot be read (or the user passes <code class="option">--seed=random</code>, see below) the seed is
    generated randomly instead, so that the partition UUIDs are also effectively random. The seed value may
    also be set explicitly, formatted as UUID via the <code class="option">--seed=</code> option. By hashing these UUIDs
    from a common seed images prepared with this tool become reproducible and the result of the algorithm
    above deterministic.</p><p>The positional argument should specify the block device to operate on. Instead of a block device
    node path a regular file may be specified too, in which case the command operates on it like it would if
    a loopback block device node was specified with the file attached. If <code class="option">--empty=create</code> is
    specified the specified path is created as regular file, which is useful for generating disk images from
    scratch.</p></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="id-1.6"></a><h2 id="Options">Options<a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this headline" href="systemd-repart.html#Options">¶</a></h2><p>The following options are understood:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt id="--dry-run="><span class="term"><code class="option">--dry-run=</code></span><a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this term" href="systemd-repart.html#--dry-run=">¶</a></dt><dd><p>Takes a boolean.

        (i.e. the minimal sizes of all partitions are summed up, taking space for additional metadata into
        account). This switch is not supported if the specified node is a block device. This switch has no
        effect if the file is already as large as the specified size or larger. The specified size is
