    name resolution.</p></div><div class="refsection"><a name="main-conf"></a><h2>Configuration Directories and Precedence</h2><p>The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is only needed when it is
    necessary to deviate from those defaults. Initially, the main configuration file in
    <code class="filename">/etc/systemd/</code> contains commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the
    administrator. Local overrides can be created by editing this file or by creating drop-ins, as described
    below. Using drop-ins for local configuration is recommended over modifications to the main configuration
    file.</p><p>In addition to the "main" configuration file, drop-in configuration snippets are read from
    <code class="filename">/usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/</code>, <code class="filename">/usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/</code>,
    and <code class="filename">/etc/systemd/*.conf.d/</code>. Those drop-ins have higher precedence and override the
    main configuration file. Files in the <code class="filename">*.conf.d/</code> configuration subdirectories are
    sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the subdirectories they
    reside. When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept just a single value, the
    entry in the file sorted last takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of values, entries
    are collected as they occur in the sorted files.</p><p>When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install drop-ins under
    <code class="filename">/usr/</code>. Files in <code class="filename">/etc/</code> are reserved for the local administrator,
    who may use this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have to
    be used to override package drop-ins, since the main configuration file has lower precedence. It is
    recommended to prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two-digit number and a dash, to
    simplify the ordering of the files.</p><p>To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink
    to <code class="filename">/dev/null</code> in the configuration directory in <code class="filename">/etc/</code>, with the
    same filename as the vendor configuration file.</p></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="id-1.7"></a><h2 id="Options">Options<a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this headline" href="resolved.conf.html#Options">¶</a></h2><p>The following options are available in the [Resolve] section:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt id="DNS="><span class="term"><code class="varname">DNS=</code></span><a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this term" href="resolved.conf.html#DNS=">¶</a></dt><dd><p>A space-separated list of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to use as system DNS servers.

        "<code class="literal">allow-downgrade</code>". If true all DNS lookups are
        DNSSEC-validated locally (excluding LLMNR and Multicast
        DNS). If the response to a lookup request is detected to be invalid
        a lookup failure is returned to applications. Note that
        this mode requires a DNS server that supports DNSSEC. If the
        DNS server does not properly support DNSSEC all validations
        will fail. If set to "<code class="literal">allow-downgrade</code>" DNSSEC
        validation is attempted, but if the server does not support
        DNSSEC properly, DNSSEC mode is automatically disabled. Note
        that this mode makes DNSSEC validation vulnerable to
        "downgrade" attacks, where an attacker might be able to
        trigger a downgrade to non-DNSSEC mode by synthesizing a DNS
        response that suggests DNSSEC was not supported. If set to
        false, DNS lookups are not DNSSEC validated.</p><p>Note that DNSSEC validation requires retrieval of
        additional DNS data, and thus results in a small DNS look-up
        time penalty.</p><p>DNSSEC requires knowledge of "trust anchors" to prove
        data integrity. The trust anchor for the Internet root domain
        is built into the resolver, additional trust anchors may be
        defined with
        <a href="dnssec-trust-anchors.d.html#"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">dnssec-trust-anchors.d</span>(5)</span></a>.
        Trust anchors may change at regular intervals, and old trust
        anchors may be revoked. In such a case DNSSEC validation is
        not possible until new trust anchors are configured locally or
        the resolver software package is updated with the new root
        trust anchor. In effect, when the built-in trust anchor is
        revoked and <code class="varname">DNSSEC=</code> is true, all further
        lookups will fail, as it cannot be proved anymore whether
        lookups are correctly signed, or validly unsigned. If
        <code class="varname">DNSSEC=</code> is set to
        "<code class="literal">allow-downgrade</code>" the resolver will
        automatically turn off DNSSEC validation in such a case.</p><p>Client programs looking up DNS data will be informed
        whether lookups could be verified using DNSSEC, or whether the
        returned data could not be verified (either because the data
        was found unsigned in the DNS, or the DNS server did not
        support DNSSEC or no appropriate trust anchors were known). In
        the latter case it is assumed that client programs employ a
        secondary scheme to validate the returned DNS data, should
        this be required.</p><p>It is recommended to set <code class="varname">DNSSEC=</code> to
        true on systems where it is known that the DNS server supports
        DNSSEC correctly, and where software or trust anchor updates
        happen regularly. On other systems it is recommended to set
        <code class="varname">DNSSEC=</code> to
        "<code class="literal">allow-downgrade</code>".</p><p>In addition to this global DNSSEC setting
        <a href="systemd-networkd.service.html#"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">systemd-networkd.service</span>(8)</span></a>
        also maintains per-link DNSSEC settings. For system DNS
        servers (see above), only the global DNSSEC setting is in
        effect. For per-link DNS servers the per-link
        setting is in effect, unless it is unset in which case the
        global setting is used instead.</p><p>Site-private DNS zones generally conflict with DNSSEC
        operation, unless a negative (if the private zone is not
        signed) or positive (if the private zone is signed) trust
        anchor is configured for them. If
        "<code class="literal">allow-downgrade</code>" mode is selected, it is
        attempted to detect site-private DNS zones using top-level
        domains (TLDs) that are not known by the DNS root server. This
        logic does not work in all private zone setups.</p><p>Defaults to "<code class="literal">allow-downgrade</code>".</p></dd><dt id="DNSOverTLS="><span class="term"><code class="varname">DNSOverTLS=</code></span><a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this term" href="resolved.conf.html#DNSOverTLS=">¶</a></dt><dd><p>Takes a boolean argument or "<code class="literal">opportunistic</code>". If
        true all connections to the server will be encrypted. Note that this
        mode requires a DNS server that supports DNS-over-TLS and has a valid
        certificate. If the hostname was specified in <code class="varname">DNS=</code>
        by using the format format "<code class="literal">address#server_name</code>" it
        is used to validate its certificate and also to enable Server Name
        Indication (SNI) when opening a TLS connection. Otherwise
        the certificate is checked against the server's IP.
        If the DNS server does not support DNS-over-TLS all DNS requests will fail.</p><p>When set to "<code class="literal">opportunistic</code>"
        DNS request are attempted to send encrypted with DNS-over-TLS.
        If the DNS server does not support TLS, DNS-over-TLS is disabled.
        Note that this mode makes DNS-over-TLS vulnerable to "downgrade"
        attacks, where an attacker might be able to trigger a downgrade
        to non-encrypted mode by synthesizing a response that suggests
        DNS-over-TLS was not supported. If set to false, DNS lookups
        are send over UDP.</p><p>Note that DNS-over-TLS requires additional data to be
        send for setting up an encrypted connection, and thus results
        in a small DNS look-up time penalty.</p><p>Note that in "<code class="literal">opportunistic</code>" mode the
