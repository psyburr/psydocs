    monitoring of seats, sessions and users. To actively make changes
    to the seat configuration, terminate login sessions, or switch
    session on a seat you need to utilize the D-Bus API of
    systemd-logind, instead.</p><p>These functions synchronously access data in
    <code class="filename">/proc/</code>, <code class="filename">/sys/fs/cgroup/</code>
    and <code class="filename">/run/</code>. All of these are virtual file
    systems, hence the runtime cost of the accesses is relatively
    cheap.</p><p>It is possible (and often a very good choice) to mix calls
    to the synchronous interface of <code class="filename">sd-login.h</code>
    with the asynchronous D-Bus interface of systemd-logind. However,
    if this is done you need to think a bit about possible races since
    the stream of events from D-Bus and from
    <code class="filename">sd-login.h</code> interfaces such as the login
    monitor are asynchronous and not ordered against each
    other.</p><p>If the functions return string arrays, these are generally

    <code class="constant">NULL</code> may be returned, which should be treated

        workplace. It consists of at least one graphics device, and usually also includes
        keyboard, mouse. It can also include video cameras, sound cards and more. Seats
        are identified by seat names, which are strings (&lt;= 255 characters), that start
        with the four characters "<code class="literal">seat</code>" followed by at least one
        character from the range [a-zA-Z0-9], "<code class="literal">_</code>" and
        "<code class="literal">-</code>". They are suitable for use as file names. Seat names may or
        may not be stable and may be reused if a seat becomes available again.
        </p></dd><dt id="session"><span class="term">session</span><a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this term" href="sd-login.html#session">¶</a></dt><dd><p>A session is defined by the time a user is logged in until they
        log out. A session is bound to one or no seats (the latter for 'virtual' ssh
        logins). Multiple sessions can be attached to the same seat, but only one of them
        can be active, the others are in the background. A session is identified by a
        short string.</p><p>
        <a href="systemd.html#"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">systemd</span>(1)</span></a>
        ensures that audit sessions are identical to systemd sessions, and uses the audit
        session ID as session ID in systemd (if auditing is enabled). In general the
        session identifier is a short string consisting only of [a-zA-Z0-9],
        "<code class="literal">_</code>" and "<code class="literal">-</code>", suitable for use as a file name.
        Session IDs are unique on the local machine and are
        never reused as long as the machine is online. A user (the way we know it on UNIX)
        corresponds to the person using a computer. A single user can have multiple
        sessions open at the same time. A user is identified by a numeric user id (UID) or
        a user name (a string). A multi-session system allows multiple user sessions on
        the same seat at the same time. A multi-seat system allows multiple independent
        seats that can be individually and simultaneously used by different users.</p></dd></dl></div><p>All hardware devices that are eligible to being assigned to a seat, are assigned
    to one. A device can be assigned to only one seat at a time. If a device is not
    assigned to any particular other seat it is implicitly assigned to the special default
    seat called "<code class="literal">seat0</code>".</p><p>Note that hardware like printers, hard disks or network cards is generally not
    assigned to a specific seat. They are available to all seats equally. (Well, with one
    exception: USB sticks can be assigned to a seat.)</p><p>"<code class="literal">seat0</code>" always exists.</p></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="id-1.7"></a><h2 id="udev Rules">udev Rules<a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this headline" href="sd-login.html#udev%20Rules">¶</a></h2><p>Assignment of hardware devices to seats is managed inside the udev database, via

This tag
        is set for graphics devices, mice, keyboards, video cards, sound cards and
        more. Note that some devices like sound cards consist of multiple subdevices
        (i.e. a PCM for input and another one for output). This tag will be set only for
        the originating device, not for the individual subdevices. A UI for configuring
        assignment of devices to seats should enumerate and subscribe to all devices with
        this tag set and show them in the UI. Note that USB hubs can be assigned to a seat
        as well, in which case all (current and future) devices plugged into it will also
        be assigned to the same seat (unless they are explicitly assigned to another
        seat).

        seat hence consists of an arbitrary number of devices marked with the
        "<code class="literal">seat</code>" tag, but (at least) one of these devices needs to be
        tagged with "<code class="literal">master-of-seat</code>" before the seat is actually
        considered to be around.</p></dd><dt id="Property ID_SEAT"><span class="term">Property <code class="varname">ID_SEAT</code></span><a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this term" href="sd-login.html#Property%20ID_SEAT">¶</a></dt><dd><p>This property specifies the name of the seat a specific device is

        to speed up enumeration of hardware belonging to a specific seat, the seat is also
        set as tag on the device. I.e. if the property
        <code class="varname">ID_SEAT=seat-waldo</code> is set for a device, the tag
        "<code class="literal">seat-waldo</code>" will be set as well. Note that if a device is
        assigned to "<code class="literal">seat0</code>", it will usually not carry such a tag and you
        need to enumerate all devices and check the <code class="varname">ID_SEAT</code> property
        manually. Again, if a device is assigned to seat0 this is visible on the device in
        two ways: with a property <code class="varname">ID_SEAT=seat0</code> and with no property

        plugged in should create a hotplug seat without further configuration.</p></dd><dt id="Property ID_FOR_SEAT"><span class="term">Property <code class="varname">ID_FOR_SEAT</code></span><a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this term" href="sd-login.html#Property%20ID_FOR_SEAT">¶</a></dt><dd><p>When creating additional (manual) seats starting from a graphics
        device this is a good choice to name the seat after. It is created from the path

        a new seat from a graphics device, read this property and prefix it with

    nodes attached to a seat as long as the user has an active session on it. This is
    mostly transparent to applications. As mentioned above, for certain user software it
    might be a good idea to watch whether they can access device nodes instead of thinking
