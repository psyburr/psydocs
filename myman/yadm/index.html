DESCRIPTION
       yadm is a tool for managing a collection of files across multiple computers, using a shared Git repository.  In addition, yadm provides a feature to select alternate versions of files for particular systems.  Lastly, yadm sup‐
       plies the ability to manage a subset of secure files, which are encrypted before they are included in the repository.

COMMANDS
       git-command or git-alias
              Any command not internally handled by yadm is passed through to <B>git(1)</B>.  Git commands or aliases are invoked with the yadm managed repository.  The working directory for Git commands will  be  the  configured  work-tree
              (usually $HOME).

              Dotfiles are managed by using standard git commands; add, commit, push, pull, etc.

              The config command is not passed directly through.  Instead use the gitconfig command (see below).

       alt    Create  symbolic  links and process templates for any managed files matching the naming rules described in the ALTERNATES and TEMPLATES sections. It is usually unnecessary to run this command, as yadm automatically pro‐
              cesses alternates by default. This automatic behavior can be disabled by setting the configuration yadm.auto-alt to "false".

       bootstrap
              Execute $HOME/.config/yadm/bootstrap if it exists.

              Encrypt all files matching the patterns found in $HOME/.config/yadm/encrypt.  See the ENCRYPTION section for more details.

       enter  Run  a  sub-shell  with all Git variables set. Exit the sub-shell the same way you leave your normal shell (usually with the "exit" command). This sub-shell can be used to easily interact with your yadm repository using
              "git" commands. This could be useful if you are using a tool which uses Git directly, such as tig, vim-fugitive, git-cola, etc.

              Optionally, you can provide a command after "enter", and instead of invoking your shell, that command will be run with all of the Git variables exposed to the command's environment.

              Emacs Tramp and Magit can manage files by using this configuration:

                  (add-to-list 'tramp-methods
                       '("yadm"
                         (tramp-login-program "yadm")
                         (tramp-login-args (("enter")))
                         (tramp-login-env (("SHELL") ("/bin/sh")))
                         (tramp-remote-shell "/bin/sh")
                         (tramp-remote-shell-args ("-c"))))

              With this config, use (magit-status "/yadm::").

       git-crypt options
              If git-crypt is installed, this command allows you to pass options directly to git-crypt, with the environment configured to use the yadm repository.

              git-crypt enables transparent encryption and decryption of files in a git repository.  You can read https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt for details.

       gitconfig
              Pass options to the git config command. Since yadm already uses the config command to manage its own configurations, this command is provided as a way to change configurations of the repository  managed  by  yadm.   One
              useful case might be to configure the repository so untracked files are shown in status commands. yadm initially configures its repository so that untracked files are not shown.  If you wish use the default Git behavior
              (to show untracked files and directories), you can remove this configuration.

                     yadm gitconfig --unset status.showUntrackedFiles

       help   Print a summary of yadm commands.

       init   Initialize a new, empty repository for tracking dotfiles.  The repository is stored in $HOME/.local/share/yadm/repo.git.  By default, $HOME will be used as the work-tree, but this can be overridden with the  -w  option.
              yadm can be forced to overwrite an existing repository by providing the -f option.

       list   Print a list of files managed by yadm.  The -a option will cause all managed files to be listed.  Otherwise, the list will only include files from the current directory or below.

       introspect category
              Report internal yadm data. Supported categories are commands, configs, repo, and switches.  The purpose of introspection is to support command line completion.

       perms  Update  permissions as described in the PERMISSIONS section.  It is usually unnecessary to run this command, as yadm automatically processes permissions by default. This automatic behavior can be disabled by setting the
              configuration yadm.auto-perms to "false".

       transcrypt options
              If transcrypt is installed, this command allows you to pass options directly to transcrypt, with the environment configured to use the yadm repository.

              transcrypt enables transparent encryption and decryption of files in a git repository.  You can read https://github.com/elasticdog/transcrypt for details.

       upgrade
              Version 3 of yadm uses a different directory for storing data.  When you start to use version 3 for the first time, you may see warnings about moving your data to this new directory.  The easiest way to accomplish  this
              is  by  running "yadm upgrade".  This command will start by moving your yadm repo to the new path.  Next it will move any archive data.  If the archive is tracked within your yadm repo, this command will "stage" the re‐

       more of these paths, it may be useful to create an alias for the yadm command.  For example, the following alias could be used to override the repository directory.

              alias yadm='yadm --yadm-repo /alternate/path/to/repo'

       The following is the full list of universal options.  Each option should be followed by a path.

       -Y,--yadm-dir
              Override the yadm directory.  yadm stores its configurations relative to this directory.

       --yadm-data
              Override the yadm data directory.  yadm stores its data relative to this directory.

       --yadm-repo
              Override the location of the yadm repository.

       --yadm-config
              Override the location of the yadm configuration file.

       --yadm-encrypt
              Override the location of the yadm encryption configuration.

       --yadm-archive
              Override the location of the yadm encrypted files archive.

       --yadm-bootstrap
              Override the location of the yadm bootstrap program.

CONFIGURATION
       yadm uses a configuration file named $HOME/.config/yadm/config.  This file uses the same format as <B>git-config(1)</B>.  Also, you can control the contents of the configuration file via the yadm config command (which  works  exactly
       like git-config).  For example, to disable alternates you can run the command:

              yadm config yadm.auto-alt false

       The following is the full list of supported configurations:

       yadm.alt-copy
              If set to "true", alternate files will be copies instead of symbolic links.  This might be desirable, because some systems may not properly support symlinks.

       yadm.auto-alt
              Disable the automatic linking described in the section ALTERNATES. If disabled, you may still run "yadm alt" manually to create the alternate links. This feature is enabled by default.

       yadm.auto-exclude
              Disable the automatic exclusion of patterns defined in $HOME/.config/yadm/encrypt.  This feature is enabled by default.

       yadm.auto-perms
              Disable the automatic permission changes described in the section PERMISSIONS.  If disabled, you may still run yadm perms manually to update permissions.  This feature is enabled by default.

       yadm.auto-private-dirs
              Disable the automatic creating of private directories described in the section PERMISSIONS.

       yadm.cipher
              Configure which encryption system is used by the encrypt/decrypt commands.  Valid options are "gpg" and "openssl". The default is "gpg".  Detailed information can be found in the section ENCRYPTION.

       yadm.openssl-ciphername
              Specify which cipher should be used by openssl.  "aes-256-cbc" is used by default.

       yadm.openssl-old
              Newer  versions  of  openssl support the pbkdf2 key derivation function. This is used by default. If this configuration is set to "true", openssl operations will use options compatible with older versions of openssl. If
              you change this option, you will need to recreate your encrypted archive.

       yadm.openssl-program
              Specify an alternate program to use instead of "openssl".  By default, the first "openssl" found in $PATH is used.

       yadm.ssh-perms
              Disable the permission changes to $HOME/.ssh/*.  This feature is enabled by default.

       The following four "local" configurations are not stored in the $HOME/.config/yadm/config, they are stored in the local repository.

       local.class
              Specify a class for the purpose of symlinking alternate files.  By default, no class will be matched.

       local.hostname
              Override the hostname for the purpose of symlinking alternate files.

       local.os
              Override the OS for the purpose of symlinking alternate files.

       local.user
              Override the user for the purpose of symlinking alternate files.

ALTERNATES
       When managing a set of files across different systems, it can be useful to have an automated way of choosing an alternate version of a file for a different operating system, host, user, etc.

       yadm will automatically create a symbolic link to the appropriate version of a file, when a valid suffix is appended to the filename. The suffix contains the conditions that must be met for that file to be used.

       The suffix begins with "##", followed by any number of conditions separated by commas.

         ##&lt;condition&gt;[,&lt;condition&gt;,...]

       Each condition is an attribute/value pair, separated by a period. Some conditions do not require a "value", and in that case, the period and value can be omitted. Most attributes can be abbreviated as a single letter.

         &lt;attribute&gt;[.&lt;value&gt;]

       These are the supported attributes, in the order of the weighted precedence:

       template, t
              Valid when the value matches a supported template processor.  See the TEMPLATES section for more details.

       user, u
              Valid if the value matches the current user.  Current user is calculated by running id -u -n.

       distro, d
              Valid if the value matches the distro.  Distro is calculated by running lsb_release -si or by inspecting the ID from /etc/os-release.

       NOTE: The OS for "Windows Subsystem for Linux" is reported as "WSL", even though uname identifies as "Linux".

       You may use any number of conditions, in any order.  An alternate will only be used if ALL conditions are valid.  For all files managed by yadm's repository or listed in $HOME/.config/yadm/encrypt, if they  match  this  naming
       convention, symbolic links will be created for the most appropriate version.

       The  "most  appropriate"  version  is determined by calculating a score for each version of a file. A template is always scored higher than any symlink condition. The number of conditions is the next largest factor in scoring.
       Files with more conditions will always be favored. Any invalid condition will disqualify that file completely.

       If you don't care to have all versions of alternates stored in the same directory as the generated symlink, you can place them in the $HOME/.config/yadm/alt directory. The generated symlink or processed template will  be  cre‐
       ated using the same relative path.

       Alternate linking may best be demonstrated by example. Assume the following files are managed by yadm's repository:

         - $HOME/path/example.txt##default
         - $HOME/path/example.txt##class.Work
         - $HOME/path/example.txt##os.Darwin
         - $HOME/path/example.txt##os.Darwin,hostname.host1
         - $HOME/path/example.txt##os.Darwin,hostname.host2
         - $HOME/path/example.txt##os.Linux
         - $HOME/path/example.txt##os.Linux,hostname.host1
         - $HOME/path/example.txt##os.Linux,hostname.host2

       If running on a Macbook named "host2", yadm will create a symbolic link which looks like this:

       $HOME/path/example.txt -&gt; $HOME/path/example.txt##os.Darwin,hostname.host2

       However, on another Mackbook named "host3", yadm will create a symbolic link which looks like this:

       $HOME/path/example.txt -&gt; $HOME/path/example.txt##os.Darwin

       Since the hostname doesn't match any of the managed files, the more generic version is chosen.

       If running on a Linux server named "host4", the link will be:

       $HOME/path/example.txt -&gt; $HOME/path/example.txt##os.Linux

       If running on a Solaris server, the link will use the default version:

       $HOME/path/example.txt -&gt; $HOME/path/example.txt##default

       If running on a system, with class set to "Work", the link will be:

       $HOME/path/example.txt -&gt; $HOME/path/example.txt##class.Work

       If no "##default" version exists and no files have valid conditions, then no link will be created.

       Links are also created for directories named this way, as long as they have at least one yadm managed file within them.

       yadm will automatically create these links by default. This can be disabled using the yadm.auto-alt configuration.  Even if disabled, links can be manually created by running yadm alt.

       Class  is  a  special  value which is stored locally on each host (inside the local repository). To use alternate symlinks using class, you must set the value of class using the configuration local.class.  This is set like any
       other yadm configuration with the yadm config command. The following sets the class to be "Work".
       ESH    ESH is a template processor written in POSIX compliant shell. It allows executing shell commands within templates. This can be used to reference your own configurations within templates, for example:

                &lt;% yadm config mysection.myconfig %&gt;

              To use the ESH template processor, specify the value of "esh"

       j2cli  To use the j2cli Jinja template processor, specify the value of "j2"  or "j2cli".

       envtpl To use the envtpl Jinja template processor, specify the value of "j2" or "envtpl".

       NOTE: Specifying "j2" as the processor will attempt to use j2cli or envtpl, whichever is available.

       If the template processor specified is available, templates will be processed to create or overwrite files.

       During processing, the following variables are available in the template:

        Default         Jinja or ESH    Description
        -------------   -------------   --------------------------
        yadm.class      YADM_CLASS      Locally defined yadm class
        yadm.distro     YADM_DISTRO     lsb_release -si
        yadm.hostname   YADM_HOSTNAME   uname -n (without domain)
        yadm.os         YADM_OS         uname -s
        yadm.user       YADM_USER       id -u -n
        yadm.source     YADM_SOURCE     Template filename

       NOTE: The OS for "Windows Subsystem for Linux" is reported as "WSL", even though uname identifies as "Linux".

       NOTE: If lsb_release is not available, DISTRO will be the ID specified in /etc/os-release.

       Examples:

       whatever##template with the following content

         {% if yadm.user == "harvey" %}
         config={{yadm.class}}-{{yadm.os}}
         {% else %}
         config=dev-whatever
         {% include "whatever.extra" %}
         {% endif %}

       would output a file named whatever with the following content if the user is "harvey":

         config=work-Linux

       and the following otherwise (if whatever.extra contains admin=false):

         config=dev-whatever
         admin=false

       An equivalent Jinja template named whatever##template.j2 would look like:

         {% if YADM_USER == 'harvey' -%}

ENCRYPTION
       It  can be useful to manage confidential files, like SSH or GPG keys, across multiple systems. However, doing so would put plain text data into a Git repository, which often resides on a public system. yadm can make it easy to
       encrypt and decrypt a set of files so the encrypted version can be maintained in the Git repository.  This feature will only work if a supported tool is available.  Both <B>gpg(1)</B> and <B>openssl(1)</B> are supported.  gpg is used by de‐
       fault, but openssl can be configured with the yadm.cypher configuration.

       To use this feature, a list of patterns must be created and saved as $HOME/.config/yadm/encrypt.  This list of patterns should be relative to the configured work-tree (usually $HOME).  For example:

                  .ssh/*.key
                  .gnupg/*.gpg

       Standard  filename  expansions (*, ?, [) are supported.  If you have Bash version 4, you may use "**" to match all subdirectories.  Other shell expansions like brace and tilde are not supported.  Spaces in paths are supported,
       and should not be quoted.  If a directory is specified, its contents will be included, but not recursively.  Paths beginning with a "!" will be excluded.

       The yadm encrypt command will find all files matching the patterns, and prompt for a password. Once a password has confirmed, the matching files will be encrypted and saved as  $HOME/.local/share/yadm/archive.   The  "encrypt"
       and "archive" files should be added to the yadm repository so they are available across multiple systems.

       To decrypt these files later, or on another system run yadm decrypt and provide the correct password.  After files are decrypted, permissions are automatically updated as described in the PERMISSIONS section.

       Symmetric encryption is used by default, but asymmetric encryption may be enabled using the yadm.gpg-recipient configuration.

       NOTE: It is recommended that you use a private repository when keeping confidential files, even though they are encrypted.

       Patterns found in $HOME/.config/yadm/encrypt are automatically added to the repository's info/exclude file every time yadm encrypt is run.  This is to prevent accidentally committing sensitive data to the repository.  This can
       be disabled using the yadm.auto-exclude configuration.

       Using transcrypt or git-crypt

       A completely separate option for encrypting data is to install and use transcrypt or git-crypt.  Once installed, you can use these tools by running yadm transcrypt or yadm git-crypt.  These tools enables transparent encryption
       and decryption of files in a git repository. See the following web sites for more information:

       - https://github.com/elasticdog/transcrypt

       - https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt

PERMISSIONS
       When  files  are checked out of a Git repository, their initial permissions are dependent upon the user's umask. Because of this, yadm will automatically update the permissions of some file paths. The "group" and "others" per‐
       missions will be removed from the following files:

       - $HOME/.local/share/yadm/archive

       - All files matching patterns in $HOME/.config/yadm/encrypt

       - The SSH directory and files, .ssh/*

       - The GPG directory and files, .gnupg/*

       yadm will automatically update permissions by default. This can be disabled using the yadm.auto-perms configuration. Even if disabled, permissions can be manually updated by running yadm perms.  The .ssh  directory  processing
       can be disabled using the yadm.ssh-perms configuration. The .gnupg directory processing can be disabled using the yadm.gpg-perms configuration.

       When  cloning a repo which includes data in a .ssh or .gnupg directory, if those directories do not exist at the time of cloning, yadm will create the directories with mask 0700 prior to merging the fetched data into the work-
       tree.
              The command which triggered the hook

       YADM_HOOK_EXIT
              The exit status of the yadm command

       YADM_HOOK_FULL_COMMAND
              The yadm command with all command line arguments (parameters are space delimited, and any space, tab or backslash will be escaped with a backslash)

       YADM_HOOK_REPO
              The path to the yadm repository

       YADM_HOOK_WORK
              The path to the work-tree

FILES
       All  of  yadm's  configurations are relative to the "yadm directory".  yadm uses the "XDG Base Directory Specification" to determine this directory.  If the environment variable $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is defined as a fully qualified
       path, this directory will be $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/yadm.  Otherwise it will be $HOME/.config/yadm.

       Similarly, yadm's data files are relative to the "yadm data directory".  yadm uses the "XDG Base Directory Specification" to determine this directory.  If the environment variable $XDG_DATA_HOME is defined as a fully qualified
       path, this directory will be $XDG_DATA_HOME/yadm.  Otherwise it will be $HOME/.local/share/yadm.

       The following are the default paths yadm uses for its own data.  Most of these paths can be altered using universal options.  See the OPTIONS section for details.

       $HOME/.config/yadm
              The yadm directory. By default, all configs yadm stores is relative to this directory.

       $HOME/.local/share/yadm
              The yadm data directory. By default, all data yadm stores is relative to this directory.

       $YADM_DIR/config
              Configuration file for yadm.

       $YADM_DIR/alt
              This is a directory to keep "alternate files" without having them side-by-side with the resulting symlink or processed template. Alternate files placed in this directory will be created relative to $HOME instead.

       $YADM_DATA/repo.git
              Git repository used by yadm.

       $YADM_DIR/encrypt
              List of globs used for encrypt/decrypt

       $YADM_DATA/archive
              All files encrypted with yadm encrypt are stored in this file.

EXAMPLES
       yadm init
              Create an empty repo for managing files

       yadm add .bash_profile ; yadm commit
              Add .bash_profile to the Git index and create a new commit

       yadm remote add origin &lt;url&gt;
