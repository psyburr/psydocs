      <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
      <p><span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span>
      searches files for character patterns, in the same way as
      other grep commands do, but it uses the PCRE2 regular
      expression library to support patterns that are compatible
      with the regular expressions of Perl 5. See <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2syntax.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2syntax</span>(3)</span></a> for a
      quick-reference summary of pattern syntax, or <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2pattern.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2pattern</span>(3)</span></a> for a full
      description of the syntax and semantics of the regular
      expressions that PCRE2 supports.</p>
      <p>Patterns, whether supplied on the command line or in a
      separate file, are given without delimiters. For example:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
pcre2grep Thursday /etc/motd
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>If you attempt to use delimiters (for example, by
      surrounding a pattern with slashes, as is common in Perl
      scripts), they are interpreted as part of the pattern. Quotes
      can of course be used to delimit patterns on the command line
      because they are interpreted by the shell, and indeed quotes
      are required if a pattern contains white space or shell
      metacharacters.</p>
      <p>The first argument that follows any option settings is
      treated as the single pattern to be matched when neither
      <code class="option">−e</code> nor <code class="option">−f</code> is present. Conversely, when one or
      both of these options are used to specify patterns, all
      arguments are treated as path names. At least one of
      <code class="option">−e</code>, <code class="option">−f</code>, or an argument pattern must be
      provided.</p>
      <p>If no files are specified, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> reads the
      standard input. The standard input can also be referenced by
      a name consisting of a single hyphen. For example:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
pcre2grep some-pattern file1 - file3
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>Input files are searched line by line. By default, each
      line that matches a pattern is copied to the standard output,
      and if there is more than one file, the file name is output
      at the start of each line, followed by a colon. However,
      there are options that can change how <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> behaves. In
      particular, the <code class="option">−M</code> option
      makes it possible to search for strings that span line
      boundaries. What defines a line boundary is controlled by the
      <code class="option">−N</code> (<code class="option">−−newline</code>) option.</p>
      <p>The amount of memory used for buffering files that are
      being scanned is controlled by parameters that can be set by
      the <code class="option">−−buffer−size</code> and
      <code class="option">−−max−buffer−size</code>
      options. The first of these sets the size of buffer that is
      obtained at the start of processing. If an input file
      contains very long lines, a larger buffer may be needed; this
      is handled by automatically extending the buffer, up to the
      limit specified by <code class="option">−−max−buffer−size</code>.
      The default values for these parameters can be set when
      <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> is
      built; if nothing is specified, the defaults are set to 20KiB
      and 1MiB respectively. An error occurs if a line is too long
      and the buffer can no longer be expanded.</p>
      <p>The block of memory that is actually used is three times
      the "buffer size", to allow for buffering "before" and
      "after" lines. If the buffer size is too small, fewer than
      requested "before" and "after" lines may be output.</p>
      <p>Patterns can be no longer than 8KiB or BUFSIZ bytes,
      whichever is the greater. BUFSIZ is defined in <code class="literal">&lt;</code><code class="filename">stdio.h</code><code class="literal">&gt;</code>
      When there is more than one pattern (specified by the use of
      <code class="option">−e</code> and/or <code class="option">−f</code>), each pattern is applied to each
      line in the order in which they are defined, except that all
      the <code class="option">−e</code> patterns are tried
      before the <code class="option">−f</code> patterns.</p>
      <p>By default, as soon as one pattern matches a line, no
      further patterns are considered. However, if <code class="option">−−colour</code> (or <code class="option">−−color</code>) is used to colour the
      matching substrings, or if <code class="option">−−only−matching</code>,
      <code class="option">−−file−offsets</code>,
      or <code class="option">−−line−offsets</code> is used to
      output only the part of the line that matched (either shown
      literally, or as an offset), scanning resumes immediately
      following the match, so that further matches on the same line
      can be found. If there are multiple patterns, they are all
      tried on the remainder of the line, but patterns that follow
      the one that matched are not tried on the earlier matched
      part of the line.</p>
      <p>This behaviour means that the order in which multiple
      patterns are specified can affect the output when one of the
      above options is used. This is no longer the same behaviour
      as GNU grep, which now manages to display earlier matches for
      later patterns (as long as there is no overlap).</p>
      <p>Patterns that can match an empty string are accepted, but
      empty string matches are never recognized. An example is the
      pattern "(super)?(man)?", in which all components are
      optional. This pattern finds all occurrences of both "super"
      and "man"; the output differs from matching with "super|man"
      when only the matching substrings are being shown.</p>
      <p>If the <code class="constant">LC_ALL</code> or
      <code class="constant">LC_CTYPE</code> environment variable
      is set, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> uses the value to
      set a locale when calling the PCRE2 library. The <code class="option">−−locale</code> option can be used to
      override this.</p>

      <h2>SUPPORT FOR COMPRESSED FILES</h2>
      <p>It is possible to compile <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> so that it uses
      <span class="command"><strong>libz</strong></span> or
      <span class="command"><strong>libbz2</strong></span> to read
      compressed files whose names end in <em class="replaceable"><code>.gz</code></em> or <em class="replaceable"><code>.bz2</code></em>, respectively. You can
      find out whether your <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> binary has
      support for one or both of these file types by running it
      with the <code class="option">−−help</code>
      option. If the appropriate support is not present, all files
      are treated as plain text. The standard input is always so
      treated. When input is from a compressed .gz or .bz2 file,
      the <code class="option">−−line−buffered</code> option is
      ignored.</p>

      <a id="pcre2grep-1_sect3" name="pcre2grep-1_sect3" shape="rect"> </a>
      <h2>BINARY FILES</h2>
      <p>By default, a file that contains a binary zero byte within
      the first 1024 bytes is identified as a binary file, and is
      processed specially. However, if the newline type is
      specified as NUL, that is, the line terminator is a binary
      zero, the test for a binary file is not applied. See the
      <code class="option">−−binary−files</code>
      option for a means of changing the way binary files are
      handled.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2grep-1_sect4" name="pcre2grep-1_sect4" shape="rect"> </a>
      <h2>BINARY ZEROS IN PATTERNS</h2>
      <p>Patterns passed from the command line are strings that are
      terminated by a binary zero, so cannot contain internal
      zeros. However, patterns that are read from a file via the
      <code class="option">−f</code> option may contain
      binary zeros.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2grep-1_sect5" name="pcre2grep-1_sect5" shape="rect"> </a>
      <h2>OPTIONS</h2>
      <p>The order in which some of the options appear can affect
      the output. For example, both the <code class="option">−H</code> and <code class="option">−l</code> options affect the printing of file
      names. Whichever comes later in the command line will be the
      one that takes effect. Similarly, except where noted below,
      if an option is given twice, the later setting is used.
      Numerical values for options may be followed by K or M, to
      signify multiplication by 1024 or 1024*1024 respectively.</p>
      <div class="variablelist">

          <dd>
            <p>This terminates the list of options. It is useful if
            the next item on the command line starts with a hyphen
            but is not an option. This allows for the processing of
            patterns and file names that start with hyphens.</p>

          <dd>
            <p>Output up to <span class="command"><strong>number</strong></span> lines of
            context after each matching line. Fewer lines are
            output if the next match or the end of the file is
            reached, or if the processing buffer size has been set
            too small. If file names and/or line numbers are being
            output, a hyphen separator is used instead of a colon
            for the context lines. A line containing "--" is output
            between each group of lines, unless they are in fact
            contiguous in the input file. The value of <span class="command"><strong>number</strong></span> is expected to
            be relatively small. When <code class="option">−c</code> is used, <code class="option">−A</code> is ignored.</p>

            output if the previous match or the start of the file
            is within <span class="command"><strong>number</strong></span> lines, or if
            the processing buffer size has been set too small. If
            file names and/or line numbers are being output, a
            hyphen separator is used instead of a colon for the
            context lines. A line containing "--" is output between
            each group of lines, unless they are in fact contiguous
            in the input file. The value of <span class="command"><strong>number</strong></span> is expected to
            be relatively small. When <code class="option">−c</code> is used, <code class="option">−B</code> is ignored.</p>

          <dd>
            <p>Specify how binary files are to be processed. If the
            word is "binary" (the default), pattern matching is
            performed on binary files, but the only output is
            "Binary file &lt;name&gt; matches" when a match
            succeeds. If the word is "text", which is equivalent to
            the <code class="option">−a</code> or
            <code class="option">−−text</code> option,
            binary files are processed in the same way as any other
            file. In this case, when a match succeeds, the output
            may be binary garbage, which can have nasty effects if
            sent to a terminal. If the word is "without-match",
            which is equivalent to the <code class="option">−I</code> option, binary files are not
            processed at all; they are assumed not to be of
            interest and are skipped without causing any output or
            affecting the return code.</p>

            <p>Output <span class="command"><strong>number</strong></span> lines of
            context both before and after each matching line. This
            is equivalent to setting both <code class="option">−A</code> and <code class="option">−B</code> to the same value.</p>

          <dd>
            <p>Do not output lines from the files that are being
            scanned; instead output the number of lines that would
            have been shown, either because they matched, or, if
            <code class="option">−v</code> is set, because
            they failed to match. By default, this count is exactly
            the same as the number of lines that would have been
            output, but if the <code class="option">−M</code>
            (multiline) option is used (without <code class="option">−v</code>), there may be more suppressed
            lines than the count (that is, the number of
            matches).</p>
            <p>If no lines are selected, the number zero is output.
            If several files are are being scanned, a count is
            output for each of them and the <code class="option">−t</code> option can be used to cause a
            total to be output at the end. However, if the
            <code class="option">−−files−with−matches</code>
            option is also used, only those files whose counts are
            greater than zero are listed. When <code class="option">−c</code> is used, the <code class="option">−A</code>, <code class="option">−B</code>, and <code class="option">−C</code> options are ignored.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−−colour</code>, <code class="option">−−color</code></span></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>If this option is given without any data, it is
            equivalent to "--colour=auto". If data is required, it
            must be given in the same shell item, separated by an
            equals sign.</p>

          <dd>
            <p>This option specifies under what circumstances the
            parts of a line that matched a pattern should be
            coloured in the output. By default, the output is not
            coloured. The value (which is optional, see above) may
            be "never", "always", or "auto". In the latter case,
            colouring happens only if the standard output is
            connected to a terminal. More resources are used when
            colouring is enabled, because <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> has to
            search for all possible matches in a line, not just
            one, in order to colour them all.</p>
            <p>The colour that is used can be specified by setting
            one of the environment variables PCRE2GREP_COLOUR,
            PCRE2GREP_COLOR, PCREGREP_COLOUR, or PCREGREP_COLOR,
            which are checked in that order. If none of these are
            set, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> looks for
            GREP_COLORS or GREP_COLOR (in that order). The value of
            the variable should be a string of two numbers,
            separated by a semicolon, except in the case of
            GREP_COLORS, which must start with "ms=" or "mt="
            followed by two semicolon-separated colours, terminated
            by the end of the string or by a colon. If GREP_COLORS
            does not start with "ms=" or "mt=" it is ignored, and
            GREP_COLOR is checked.</p>
            <p>If the string obtained from one of the above
            variables contains any characters other than semicolon
            or digits, the setting is ignored and the default
            colour is used. The string is copied directly into the
            control string for setting colour on a terminal, so it
            is your responsibility to ensure that the values make
            sense. If no relevant environment variable is set, the
            default is "1;31", which gives red.</p>

            used multiple times in order to specify several
            patterns. It can also be used as a way of specifying a
            single pattern that starts with a hyphen. When
            <code class="option">−e</code> is used, no
            argument pattern is taken from the command line; all
            arguments are treated as file names. There is no limit
            to the number of patterns. They are applied to each
            line in the order in which they are defined until one
            matches.</p>
            <p>If <code class="option">−f</code> is used with
            <code class="option">−e</code>, the command line
            patterns are matched first, followed by the patterns
            from the file(s), independent of the order in which
            these options are specified. Note that multiple use of
            <code class="option">−e</code> is not the same as
            a single pattern with alternatives. For example, X|Y
            finds the first character in a line that is X or Y,
            whereas if the two patterns are given separately, with
            X first, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> finds X if
            it is present, even if it follows Y in the line. It
            finds Y only if there is no X in the line. This matters
            only if you are using <code class="option">−o</code> or <code class="option">−−colo(u)r</code> to show the
            part(s) of the line that matched.</p>

            them against each line of input. As is the case with
            patterns on the command line, no delimiters should be

            is the operating system's default interpretation of \n.
            The <code class="option">−−newline</code>
            option has no effect on this option. Trailing white
            space is removed from each line, and blank lines are
            ignored. An empty file contains no patterns and
            therefore matches nothing. Patterns read from a file in
            this way may contain binary zeros, which are treated as
            ordinary data characters. See also the comments about
            multiple patterns versus a single pattern with

            tested before the file's patterns. However, no other

            must be matched as part of the pattern. For example, to
            find the phrase "regular expression" in a file where
            "regular" might be at the end of a line and
            "expression" at the start of the next line, you could
            use this command:</p>
            <div class="informalexample">
              <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
pcre2grep -M 'regular\s+expression' &lt;file&gt;
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>The \s escape sequence matches any white space
            character, including newlines, and is followed by + so
            as to match trailing white space on the first line as
            well as possibly handling a two-character newline
            sequence.</p>
            <p>There is a limit to the number of lines that can be
            matched, imposed by the way that <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> buffers the
            input file as it scans it. With a sufficiently large
            processing buffer, this should not be a problem, but
            the <code class="option">−M</code> option does
            not work when input is read line by line (see
            <code class="option">−−line−buffered</code>.)</p>
          </dd>
          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−m</code> <span class="command"><strong>number</strong></span>, <code class="option">−−max−count</code>=<span class="command"><strong>number</strong></span></span></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Stop processing after finding <span class="command"><strong>number</strong></span> matching
            lines, or non-matching lines if <code class="option">−v</code> is also set. Any trailing
            context lines are output after the final match. In
            multiline mode, each multiline match counts as just one
            line for this purpose. If this limit is reached when
            reading the standard input from a regular file, the
            file is left positioned just after the last matching
            line. If <code class="option">−c</code> is also
            set, the count that is output is never greater than
            <span class="command"><strong>number</strong></span>.
            This option has no effect if used with <code class="option">−L</code>, <code class="option">−l</code>, or <code class="option">−q</code>, or when just checking for a
            match in a binary file.</p>
          </dd>

          <dd>
            <p>Processing some regular expression patterns may take
            a very long time to search for all possible matching
            strings. Others may require a very large amount of
            memory. There are three options that set resource
            limits for matching.</p>
            <p>The <code class="option">−−match−limit</code> option
            provides a means of limiting computing resource usage
            when processing patterns that are not going to match,
            but which have a very large number of possibilities in
            their search trees. The classic example is a pattern
            that uses nested unlimited repeats. Internally, PCRE2
            has a counter that is incremented each time around its
            main processing loop. If the value set by <code class="option">−−match−limit</code> is
            reached, an error occurs.</p>
            <p>The <code class="option">−−heap−limit</code> option
            specifies, as a number of kibibytes (units of 1024
            bytes), the amount of heap memory that may be used for
            matching. Heap memory is needed only if matching the
            pattern requires a significant number of nested
            backtracking points to be remembered. This parameter
            can be set to zero to forbid the use of heap memory
            altogether.</p>
            <p>The <code class="option">−−depth−limit</code> option
            limits the depth of nested backtracking points, which
            indirectly limits the amount of memory that is used.
            The amount of memory needed for each backtracking point
            depends on the number of capturing parentheses in the
            pattern, so the amount of memory that is used before
            this limit acts varies from pattern to pattern. This
            limit is of use only if it is set smaller than
            <code class="option">−−match−limit</code>.</p>
            <p>There are no short forms for these options. The
            default limits can be set when the PCRE2 library is
            compiled; if they are not specified, the defaults are
            very large and so effectively unlimited.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−−max−buffer−size</code>=<span class="command"><strong>number</strong></span></span></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>This limits the expansion of the processing buffer,
            whose initial size can be set by <code class="option">−−buffer−size</code>. The
            maximum buffer size is silently forced to be no smaller
            than the starting buffer size.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−N</code> <em class="replaceable"><code>newline-type</code></em>,

          <dd>
            <p>Six different conventions for indicating the ends of
            lines in scanned files are supported. For example:</p>
            <div class="informalexample">
              <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
pcre2grep -N CRLF 'some pattern' &lt;file&gt;
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>The newline type may be specified in upper, lower,
            or mixed case. If the newline type is NUL, lines are
            separated by binary zero characters. The other types
            are the single-character sequences CR (carriage return)
            and LF (linefeed), the two-character sequence CRLF, an
            "anycrlf" type, which recognizes any of the preceding
            three types, and an "any" type, for which any Unicode
            line ending sequence is assumed to end a line. The
            Unicode sequences are the three just mentioned, plus VT
            (vertical tab, U+000B), FF (form feed, U+000C), NEL
            (next line, U+0085), LS (line separator, U+2028), and
            PS (paragraph separator, U+2029).</p>
            <p>When the PCRE2 library is built, a default
            line-ending sequence is specified. This is normally the
            standard sequence for the operating system. Unless
            otherwise specified by this option, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> uses the
            library's default.</p>
            <p>This option makes it possible to use <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> to scan
            files that have come from other environments without
            having to modify their line endings. If the data that
            is being scanned does not agree with the convention set
            by this option, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> may behave
            in strange ways. Note that this option does not apply
            to files specified by the <code class="option">−f</code>, <code class="option">−−exclude−from</code>, or
            <code class="option">−−include−from</code>
            options, which are expected to use the operating
            system's standard newline sequence.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−n</code>, <code class="option">−−line−number</code></span></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Precede each output line by its line number in the
            file, followed by a colon for matching lines or a
            hyphen for context lines. If the file name is also
            being output, it precedes the line number. When the
            <code class="option">−M</code> option causes a
            pattern to match more than one line, only the first is
            preceded by its line number. This option is forced if
            <code class="option">−−line−offsets</code> is

            <p>If the PCRE2 library is built with support for

            <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span>
            automatically makes use of this, unless it was
            explicitly disabled at build time. This option can be
            used to disable the use of JIT at run time. It is
            provided for testing and working round problems. It
            should never be needed in normal use.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−O</code> <span class="command"><strong>text</strong></span>, <code class="option">−−output</code>=<span class="command"><strong>text</strong></span></span></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>When there is a match, instead of outputting the
            line that matched, output just the text specified in
            this option, followed by an operating-system standard
            newline. In this mode, no context is shown. That is,
            the <code class="option">−A</code>, <code class="option">−B</code>, and <code class="option">−C</code> options are ignored. The
            <code class="option">−−newline</code>
            option has no effect on this option, which is mutually
            exclusive with <code class="option">−−only−matching</code>,
            <code class="option">−−file−offsets</code>, and
            <code class="option">−−line−offsets</code>.
            However, like <code class="option">−−only−matching</code>, if
            there is more than one match in a line, each of them
            causes a line of output.</p>
            <p>Escape sequences starting with a dollar character
            may be used to insert the contents of the matched part
            of the line and/or captured substrings into the
            text.</p>
            <p>$&lt;digits&gt; or ${&lt;digits&gt;} is replaced by
            the captured substring of the given decimal number;
            zero substitutes the whole match. If the number is
            greater than the number of capturing substrings, or if
            the capture is unset, the replacement is empty.</p>
            <p>$a is replaced by bell; $b by backspace; $e by
            escape; $f by form feed; $n by newline; $r by carriage
            return; $t by tab; $v by vertical tab.</p>
            <p>$o&lt;digits&gt; or $o{&lt;digits&gt;} is replaced
            by the character whose code point is the given octal
            number. In the first form, up to three octal digits are
            processed. When more digits are needed in Unicode mode
            to specify a wide character, the second form must be
            used.</p>
            <p>$x&lt;digits&gt; or $x{&lt;digits&gt;} is replaced
            by the character represented by the given hexadecimal
            number. In the first form, up to two hexadecimal digits
            are processed. When more digits are needed in Unicode
            mode to specify a wide character, the second form must
            be used.</p>
            <p>Any other character is substituted by itself. In
            particular, $$ is replaced by a single dollar.</p>

            is more than one match in a line, each of them is shown
            separately, on a separate line of output. If

            output unless the file name or line number are being

            <p>Show only the part of the line that matched the
            capturing parentheses of the given number. Up to 50
            capturing parentheses are supported by default. This
            limit can be changed via the <code class="option">−−om−capture</code> option.
            A pattern may contain any number of capturing
            parentheses, but only those whose number is within the
            limit can be accessed by <code class="option">−o</code>. An error occurs if the number
            specified by <code class="option">−o</code> is
            greater than the limit.</p>
            <p>-o0 is the same as <code class="option">−o</code> without a number. Because
            these options can be given without an argument (see
            above), if an argument is present, it must be given in
            the same shell item, for example, -o3 or
            --only-matching=2. The comments given for the
            non-argument case above also apply to this option. If
            the specified capturing parentheses do not exist in the
            pattern, or were not set in the match, nothing is
            output unless the file name or line number are being
            output.</p>
            <p>If this option is given multiple times, multiple
            substrings are output for each match, in the order the
            options are given, and all on one line. For example,
            -o3 -o1 -o3 causes the substrings matched by capturing
            parentheses 3 and 1 and then 3 again to be output. By
            default, there is no separator (but see the next but

            <code class="option">−−output</code>, which
            specify parts of a match that are to be output, are

          <dd>
            <p>Force the patterns only to match "words". That is,
            there must be a word boundary at the start and end of
            each matched string. This is equivalent to having
            "\b(?:" at the start of each pattern, and ")\b" at the
            end. This option applies only to the patterns that are
            matched against the contents of files; it does not
            apply to patterns specified by any of the <code class="option">−−include</code> or <code class="option">−−exclude</code> options.</p>

            match entire lines. In multiline mode the match may be
            more than one line. This is equivalent to having "^(?:"
            at the start of each pattern and ")$" at the end. This
            option applies only to the patterns that are matched
            against the contents of files; it does not apply to
            patterns specified by any of the <code class="option">−−include</code> or <code class="option">−−exclude</code> options.</p>

      <h2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h2>
      <p>The environment variables <code class="constant">LC_ALL</code> and <code class="constant">LC_CTYPE</code> are examined, in that order, for a
      locale. The first one that is set is used. This can be
      overridden by the <code class="option">−−locale</code> option. If no locale is
      set, the PCRE2 library's default (usually the "C" locale) is
      used.</p>

      <h2>NEWLINES</h2>
      <p>The <code class="option">−N</code> (<code class="option">−−newline</code>) option allows
      <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> to
      scan files with newline conventions that differ from the
      default. This option affects only the way scanned files are
      processed. It does not affect the interpretation of files
      specified by the <code class="option">−f</code>,
      <code class="option">−−file−list</code>,
      <code class="option">−−exclude−from</code>,
      or <code class="option">−−include−from</code> options.</p>
      <p>Any parts of the scanned input files that are written to
      the standard output are copied with whatever newline
      sequences they have in the input. However, if the final line
      of a file is output, and it does not end with a newline
      sequence, a newline sequence is added. If the newline setting
      is CR, LF, CRLF or NUL, that line ending is output; for the
      other settings (ANYCRLF or ANY) a single NL is used.</p>
      <p>The newline setting does not affect the way in which
      <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span>
      writes newlines in informational messages to the standard
      output and error streams. Under Windows, the standard output
      is set to be binary, so that "\r\n" at the ends of output
      lines that are copied from the input is not converted to
      "\r\r\n" by the C I/O library. This means that any messages
      written to the standard output must end with "\r\n". For all
      other operating systems, and for all messages to the standard
      error stream, "\n" is used.</p>

      <h2>OPTIONS COMPATIBILITY</h2>
      <p>Many of the short and long forms of <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span>'s options are the
      same as in the GNU <span class="command"><strong>grep</strong></span> program. Any long
      option of the form <code class="option">−−xxx−regexp</code> (GNU
      terminology) is also available as <code class="option">−−xxx−regex</code> (PCRE2
      terminology). However, the <code class="option">−−depth−limit</code>, <code class="option">−−file−list</code>, <code class="option">−−file−offsets</code>,
      <code class="option">−−heap−limit</code>,
      <code class="option">−−include−dir</code>,
      <code class="option">−−line−offsets</code>,
      <code class="option">−−locale</code>,
      <code class="option">−−match−limit</code>,
      <code class="option">−M</code>, <code class="option">−−multiline</code>, <code class="option">−N</code>, <code class="option">−−newline</code>, <code class="option">−−om−separator</code>,
      <code class="option">−−output</code>,
      <code class="option">−u</code>, <code class="option">−−utf</code>, <code class="option">−U</code>, and <code class="option">−−utf−allow−invalid</code>
      options are specific to <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span>, as is the use of
      the <code class="option">−−only−matching</code> option with
      a capturing parentheses number.</p>
      <p>Although most of the common options work the same way, a
      few are different in <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span>. For example, the
      <code class="option">−−include</code> option's
      argument is a glob for GNU <span class="command"><strong>grep</strong></span>, but a regular
      expression for <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span>. If both the
      <code class="option">−c</code> and <code class="option">−l</code> options are given, GNU grep lists
      only file names, without counts, but <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> gives the counts
      as well.</p>

      <h2>OPTIONS WITH DATA</h2>
      <p>There are four different ways in which an option with data
      can be specified. If a short form option is used, the data
      may follow immediately, or (with one exception) in the next
      command line item. For example:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 -f/some/file
 -f /some/file
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>The exception is the <code class="option">−o</code>
      option, which may appear with or without data. Because of
      this, if data is present, it must follow immediately in the
      same item, for example -o3.</p>
      <p>If a long form option is used, the data may appear in the
      same command line item, separated by an equals character, or
      (with two exceptions) it may appear in the next command line
      item. For example:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 --file=/some/file
 --file /some/file
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>Note, however, that if you want to supply a file name
      beginning with ~ as data in a shell command, and have the
      shell expand ~ to a home directory, you must separate the
      file name from the option, because the shell does not treat ~
      specially unless it is at the start of an item.</p>
      <p>The exceptions to the above are the <code class="option">−−colour</code> (or <code class="option">−−color</code>) and <code class="option">−−only−matching</code> options,
      for which the data is optional. If one of these options does
      have data, it must be given in the first form, using an
      equals character. Otherwise <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> will assume that
      it has no data.</p>

      <h2>USING PCRE2'S CALLOUT FACILITY</h2>
      <p><span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span>
      has, by default, support for calling external programs or
      scripts or echoing specific strings during matching by making
      use of PCRE2's callout facility. However, this support can be
      completely or partially disabled when <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> is built. You can
      find out whether your binary has support for callouts by
      running it with the <code class="option">−−help</code> option. If callout support
      is completely disabled, all callouts in patterns are ignored
      by <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span>.
      If the facility is partially disabled, calling external
      programs is not supported, and callouts that request it are
      ignored.</p>
      <p>A callout in a PCRE2 pattern is of the form
      (?C&lt;arg&gt;) where the argument is either a number or a
      quoted string (see the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2callout.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2callout</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation for details). Numbered callouts are ignored by
      <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span>; only
      callouts with string arguments are useful.</p>
      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2grep-1_sect11" name="pcre2grep-1_sect11" shape="rect"> </a>
        <h3>Echoing a specific string</h3>
        <p>Starting the callout string with a pipe character
        invokes an echoing facility that avoids calling an external
        program or script. This facility is always available,
        provided that callouts were not completely disabled when
        <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> was
        built. The rest of the callout string is processed as a
        zero-terminated string, which means it should not contain
        any internal binary zeros. It is written to the output,
        having first been passed through the same escape processing
        as text from the <code class="option">−−output</code> (<code class="option">−O</code>) option (see above). However, $0
        cannot be used to insert a matched substring because the
        match is still in progress. Instead, the single character
        '0' is inserted. Any syntax errors in the string (for
        example, a dollar not followed by another character) causes
        the callout to be ignored. No terminator is added to the
        output string, so if you want a newline, you must include
        it explicitly using the escape $n. For example:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
pcre2grep '(.)(..(.))(?C"|[$1] [$2] [$3]$n")' &lt;some file&gt;
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Matching continues normally after the string is output.
        If you want to see only the callout output but not any
        output from an actual match, you should end the pattern
        with (*FAIL).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2grep-1_sect12" name="pcre2grep-1_sect12" shape="rect"> </a>
        <h3>Calling external programs or scripts</h3>
        <p>This facility can be independently disabled when
        <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> is
        built. It is supported for Windows, where a call to
        <code class="function">_spawnvp</code>() is used, for VMS,
        where <code class="function">lib$spawn</code>() is used,
        and for any Unix-like environment where <code class="function">fork</code>() and <code class="function">execv</code>() are available.</p>
        <p>If the callout string does not start with a pipe
        (vertical bar) character, it is parsed into a list of
        substrings separated by pipe characters. The first
        substring must be an executable name, with the following
        substrings specifying arguments:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
executable_name|arg1|arg2|...
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Any substring (including the executable name) may
        contain escape sequences started by a dollar character.
        These are the same as for the <code class="option">−−output</code> (<code class="option">−O</code>) option documented above, except
        that $0 cannot insert the matched string because the match
        is still in progress. Instead, the character '0' is
        inserted. If you need a literal dollar or pipe character in
        any substring, use $$ or $| respectively. Here is an
        example:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 echo -e "abcde\n12345" | pcre2grep \
   '(?x)(.)(..(.))
   (?C"/bin/echo|Arg1: [$1] [$2] [$3]|Arg2: $|${1}$| ($4)")()' -
</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
Output:
</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   Arg1: [a] [bcd] [d] Arg2: |a| ()
   abcde
   Arg1: [1] [234] [4] Arg2: |1| ()
   12345
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>The parameters for the system call that is used to run
        the program or script are zero-terminated strings. This
        means that binary zero characters in the callout argument
        will cause premature termination of their substrings, and
        therefore should not be present. Any syntax errors in the
        string (for example, a dollar not followed by another
        character) causes the callout to be ignored. If running the
        program fails for any reason (including the non-existence
        of the executable), a local matching failure occurs and the
        matcher backtracks in the normal way.</p>

      <h2>MATCHING ERRORS</h2>
      <p>It is possible to supply a regular expression that takes a
      very long time to fail to match certain lines. Such patterns
      normally involve nested indefinite repeats, for example:
      (a+)*\d when matched against a line of a's with no final
      digit. The PCRE2 matching function has a resource limit that
      causes it to abort in these circumstances. If this happens,
      <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span>
      outputs an error message and the line that caused the problem
      to the standard error stream. If there are more than 20 such
      errors, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> gives up.</p>
      <p>The <code class="option">−−match−limit</code> option of
      <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> can
      be used to set the overall resource limit. There are also
      other limits that affect the amount of memory used during
      matching; see the discussion of <code class="option">−−heap−limit</code> and
      <code class="option">−−depth−limit</code>
      above.</p>

      <h2>DIAGNOSTICS</h2>
      <p>Exit status is 0 if any matches were found, 1 if no
      matches were found, and 2 for syntax errors, overlong lines,
      non-existent or inaccessible files (even if matches were
      found in other files) or too many matching errors. Using the
      <code class="option">−s</code> option to suppress error
      messages about inaccessible files does not affect the return
      code.</p>
      <p>When run under VMS, the return code is placed in the
      symbol PCRE2GREP_RC because VMS does not distinguish between
      exit(0) and exit(1).</p>
