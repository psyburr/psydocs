      <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
      <p>The timezone information files used by <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/tzset.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">tzset</span>(3)</span></a> are typically
      found under a directory with a name like <code class="filename">/usr/share/zoneinfo</code>. These files use the
      format described in Internet RFC 8536. Each file is a
      sequence of 8-bit bytes. In a file, a binary integer is
      represented by a sequence of one or more bytes in network
      order (bigendian, or high-order byte first), with all bits
      significant, a signed binary integer is represented using
      two's complement, and a boolean is represented by a one-byte
      binary integer that is either 0 (false) or 1 (true). The
      format begins with a 44-byte header containing the following
      fields:</p>

                <p>The standard/wall and UT/local indicators were
                designed for transforming a TZif file's transition
                times into transitions appropriate for another time
                zone specified via a POSIX-style TZ string that
                lacks rules. For example, when TZ="EET-2EEST" and
                there is no TZif file "EET-2EEST", the idea was to
                adapt the transition times from a TZif file with
                the well-known name "posixrules" that is present
                only for this purpose and is a copy of the file
                "Europe/Brussels", a file with a different UT
                offset. POSIX does not specify this obsolete
                transformational behavior, the default rules are
                installation-dependent, and no implementation is
                known to support this feature for timestamps past
                2037, so users desiring (say) Greek time should
                instead specify TZ="Europe/Athens" for better
                historical coverage, falling back on
                TZ="EET-2EEST,M3.5.0/3,M10.5.0/4" if POSIX
                conformance is required and older timestamps need
                not be handled accurately.</p>

        <h3>Version 2 format</h3>
        <p>For version-2-format timezone files, the above header
        and data are followed by a second header and data,
        identical in format except that eight bytes are used for
        each transition time or leap second time. (Leap second
        counts remain four bytes.) After the second header and data
        comes a newline-enclosed,
        POSIX-TZ-environment-variable-style string for use in
        handling instants after the last transition time stored in
        the file or for all instants if the file has no
        transitions. The POSIX-style TZ string is empty (i.e.,
        nothing between the newlines) if there is no POSIX
        representation for such instants. If nonempty, the
        POSIX-style TZ string must agree with the local time type
        after the last transition time if present in the eight-byte
        data; for example, given the string
        "WET0WEST,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3" then if a last transition time
        is in July, the transition's local time type must specify a
        daylight-saving time abbreviated "WEST" that is one hour
        east of UT. Also, if there is at least one transition, time
        type 0 is associated with the time period from the
        indefinite past up to but not including the earliest
        transition time.</p>

        unsigned values from 0 through 24. Second, DST is in effect
        all year if it starts January 1 at 00:00 and ends December
        31 at 24:00 plus the difference between daylight saving and
        standard time.</p>

        <h3>Interoperability considerations</h3>
        <p>Future changes to the format may append more data.</p>
        <p>Version 1 files are considered a legacy format and
        should be avoided, as they do not support transition times
        after the year 2038. Readers that only understand Version 1
        must ignore any data that extends beyond the calculated end
        of the version 1 data block.</p>
        <p>Writers should generate a version 3 file if TZ string
        extensions are necessary to accurately model transition
        times. Otherwise, version 2 files should be generated.</p>
        <p>The sequence of time changes defined by the version 1
        header and data block should be a contiguous subsequence of
        the time changes defined by the version 2+ header and data
        block, and by the footer. This guideline helps obsolescent
        version 1 readers agree with current readers about
        timestamps within the contiguous subsequence. It also lets
        writers not supporting obsolescent readers use a <em class="replaceable"><code>tzh_timecnt</code></em> of zero in the
        version 1 data block to save space.</p>
        <p>Time zone designations should consist of at least three
        (3) and no more than six (6) ASCII characters from the set
        of alphanumerics, "-", and "+". This is for compatibility
        with POSIX requirements for time zone abbreviations.</p>
        <p>When reading a version 2 or 3 file, readers should
        ignore the version 1 header and data block except for the
        purpose of skipping over them.</p>
        <p>Readers should calculate the total lengths of the
        headers and data blocks and check that they all fit within
        the actual file size, as part of a validity check for the
        file.</p>

        <h3>Common interoperability issues</h3>
        <p>This section documents common problems in reading or
        writing TZif files. Most of these are problems in
        generating TZif files for use by older readers. The goals
        of this section are:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>to help TZif writers output files that avoid
              common pitfalls in older or buggy TZif readers,</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>to help TZif readers avoid common pitfalls when
              reading files generated by future TZif writers,
              and</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>to help any future specification authors see what
              sort of problems arise when the TZif format is
              changed.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>When new versions of the TZif format have been defined,
        a design goal has been that a reader can successfully use a
        TZif file even if the file is of a later TZif version than
        what the reader was designed for. When complete
        compatibility was not achieved, an attempt was made to
        limit glitches to rarely used timestamps, and to allow
        simple partial workarounds in writers designed to generate
        new-version data useful even for older-version readers.
        This section attempts to document these compatibility
        issues and workarounds, as well as to document other common
        bugs in readers.</p>
        <p>Interoperability problems with TZif include the
        following:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Some readers examine only version 1 data. As a
              partial workaround, a writer can output as much
              version 1 data as possible. However, a reader should
              ignore version 1 data, and should use version 2+ data
              even if the reader's native timestamps have only 32
              bits.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Some readers designed for version 2 might
              mishandle timestamps after a version 3 file's last
              transition, because they cannot parse extensions to
              POSIX in the TZ-like string. As a partial workaround,
              a writer can output more transitions than necessary,
              so that only far-future timestamps are mishandled by
              version 2 readers.</p>

              <p>Some readers designed for version 2 do not support
              permanent daylight saving time, e.g., a TZ string
              "EST5EDT,0/0,J365/25" denoting permanent Eastern
              Daylight Time (−04). As a partial workaround, a
              writer can substitute standard time for the next time
              zone east, e.g., "AST4" for permanent Atlantic
              Standard Time (−04).</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Some readers ignore the footer, and instead
              predict future timestamps from the time type of the

              can output more transitions than necessary.</p>

              <p>Some readers do not use time type 0 for timestamps

              select time type 0. As a partial workaround, a writer
              can output a dummy (no-op) first transition at an
              early time.</p>

              timestamps are likely to be more prone to this
              problem, for example, when they process 64-bit
              transitions only some of which are representable in
              32 bits. As a partial workaround, a writer can output
              a dummy transition at timestamp −2**31.</p>

              abbreviations containing only alphabetic
              characters.</p>

              daylight-saving time UT offsets that are less than
              the UT offsets for the corresponding standard time.
              These readers do not support locations like Ireland,
              which uses the equivalent of the POSIX TZ string
              "IST-1GMT0,M10.5.0,M3.5.0/1", observing standard time
              (IST, +01) in summer and daylight saving time (GMT,
              +00) in winter. As a partial workaround, a writer can
              output data for the equivalent of the POSIX TZ string
              "GMT0IST,M3.5.0/1,M10.5.0", thus swapping standard
              and daylight saving time. Although this workaround
              misidentifies which part of the year uses daylight
              saving time, it records UT offsets and time zone
              abbreviations correctly.</p>
