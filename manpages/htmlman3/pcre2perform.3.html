      <h2>PCRE2 PERFORMANCE</h2>
      <p>Two aspects of performance are discussed below: memory
      usage and processing time. The way you express your pattern
      as a regular expression can affect both of them.</p>

      <h2>COMPILED PATTERN MEMORY USAGE</h2>
      <p>Patterns are compiled by PCRE2 into a reasonably efficient
      interpretive code, so that most simple patterns do not use
      much memory for storing the compiled version. However, there
      is one case where the memory usage of a compiled pattern can
      be unexpectedly large. If a parenthesized group has a
      quantifier with a minimum greater than 1 and/or a limited
      maximum, the whole group is repeated in the compiled code.
      For example, the pattern</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(abc|def){2,4}
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>is compiled as if it were</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(abc|def)(abc|def)((abc|def)(abc|def)?)?
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>(Technical aside: It is done this way so that backtrack
      points within each of the repetitions can be independently
      maintained.)</p>
      <p>For regular expressions whose quantifiers use only small
      numbers, this is not usually a problem. However, if the
      numbers are large, and particularly if such repetitions are
      nested, the memory usage can become an embarrassment. For
      example, the very simple pattern</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
((ab){1,1000}c){1,3}
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>uses over 50KiB when compiled using the 8-bit library.
      When PCRE2 is compiled with its default internal pointer size
      of two bytes, the size limit on a compiled pattern is 65535
      code units in the 8-bit and 16-bit libraries, and this is
      reached with the above pattern if the outer repetition is
      increased from 3 to 4. PCRE2 can be compiled to use larger
      internal pointers and thus handle larger compiled patterns,
      but it is better to try to rewrite your pattern to use less
      memory if you can.</p>
      <p>One way of reducing the memory usage for such patterns is
      to make use of PCRE2's "subroutine" facility. Re-writing the
      above pattern as</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
((ab)(?2){0,999}c)(?1){0,2}
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>reduces the memory requirements to around 16KiB, and
      indeed it remains under 20KiB even with the outer repetition
      increased to 100. However, this kind of pattern is not always
      exactly equivalent, because any captures within subroutine
      calls are lost when the subroutine completes. If this is not
      a problem, this kind of rewriting will allow you to process
      patterns that PCRE2 cannot otherwise handle. The matching
      performance of the two different versions of the pattern are
      roughly the same. (This applies from release 10.30 - things
      were different in earlier releases.)</p>

      <h2>STACK AND HEAP USAGE AT RUN TIME</h2>
      <p>From release 10.30, the interpretive (non-JIT) version of
      <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() uses very little
      system stack at run time. In earlier releases recursive
      function calls could use a great deal of stack, and this
      could cause problems, but this usage has been eliminated.
      Backtracking positions are now explicitly remembered in
      memory frames controlled by the code. An initial 20KiB vector
      of frames is allocated on the system stack (enough for about
      100 frames for small patterns), but if this is insufficient,
      heap memory is used. The amount of heap memory can be
      limited; if the limit is set to zero, only the initial stack
      vector is used. Rewriting patterns to be time-efficient, as
      described below, may also reduce the memory requirements.</p>
      <p>In contrast to <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(), <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>() does use recursive
      function calls, but only for processing atomic groups,
      lookaround assertions, and recursion within the pattern. The
      original version of the code used to allocate quite large
      internal workspace vectors on the stack, which caused some
      problems for some patterns in environments with small stacks.
      From release 10.32 the code for <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>() has been re-factored to
      use heap memory when necessary for internal workspace when
      recursing, though recursive function calls are still
      used.</p>
      <p>The "match depth" parameter can be used to limit the depth
      of function recursion, and the "match heap" parameter to
      limit heap memory in <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>().</p>

      <h2>PROCESSING TIME</h2>
      <p>Certain items in regular expression patterns are processed
      more efficiently than others. It is more efficient to use a
      character class like [aeiou] than a set of single-character
      alternatives such as (a|e|i|o|u). In general, the simplest
      construction that provides the required behaviour is usually
      the most efficient. Jeffrey Friedl's book contains a lot of
      useful general discussion about optimizing regular
      expressions for efficient performance. This document contains
      a few observations about PCRE2.</p>
      <p>Using Unicode character properties (the \p, \P, and \X
      escapes) is slow, because PCRE2 has to use a multi-stage
      table lookup whenever it needs a character's property. If you
      can find an alternative pattern that does not use character
      properties, it will probably be faster.</p>
      <p>By default, the escape sequences \b, \d, \s, and \w, and
      the POSIX character classes such as [:alpha:] do not use
      Unicode properties, partly for backwards compatibility, and
      partly for performance reasons. However, you can set the
      PCRE2_UCP option or start the pattern with (*UCP) if you want
      Unicode character properties to be used. This can double the
      matching time for items such as \d, when matched with
      <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(); the performance
      loss is less with a DFA matching function, and in both cases
      there is not much difference for \b.</p>
      <p>When a pattern begins with .* not in atomic parentheses,
      nor in parentheses that are the subject of a backreference,
      and the PCRE2_DOTALL option is set, the pattern is implicitly
      anchored by PCRE2, since it can match only at the start of a
      subject string. If the pattern has multiple top-level
      branches, they must all be anchorable. The optimization can
      be disabled by the PCRE2_NO_DOTSTAR_ANCHOR option, and is
      automatically disabled if the pattern contains (*PRUNE) or
      (*SKIP).</p>
      <p>If PCRE2_DOTALL is not set, PCRE2 cannot make this
      optimization, because the dot metacharacter does not then
      match a newline, and if the subject string contains newlines,
      the pattern may match from the character immediately
      following one of them instead of from the very start. For
      example, the pattern</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
.*second
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>matches the subject "first\nand second" (where \n stands
      for a newline character), with the match starting at the
      seventh character. In order to do this, PCRE2 has to retry
      the match starting after every newline in the subject.</p>
      <p>If you are using such a pattern with subject strings that
      do not contain newlines, the best performance is obtained by
      setting PCRE2_DOTALL, or starting the pattern with ^.* or
      ^.*? to indicate explicit anchoring. That saves PCRE2 from
      having to scan along the subject looking for a newline to
      restart at.</p>
      <p>Beware of patterns that contain nested indefinite repeats.
      These can take a long time to run when applied to a string
      that does not match. Consider the pattern fragment</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
^(a+)*
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>This can match "aaaa" in 16 different ways, and this
      number increases very rapidly as the string gets longer. (The
      * repeat can match 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 times, and for each of
      those cases other than 0 or 4, the + repeats can match
      different numbers of times.) When the remainder of the
      pattern is such that the entire match is going to fail, PCRE2
      has in principle to try every possible variation, and this
      can take an extremely long time, even for relatively short
      strings.</p>
      <p>An optimization catches some of the more simple cases such
      as</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(a+)*b
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>where a literal character follows. Before embarking on the
      standard matching procedure, PCRE2 checks that there is a "b"
      later in the subject string, and if there is not, it fails
      the match immediately. However, when there is no following
      literal this optimization cannot be used. You can see the
      difference by comparing the behaviour of</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(a+)*\d
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>with the pattern above. The former gives a failure almost
      instantly when applied to a whole line of "a" characters,
      whereas the latter takes an appreciable time with strings
      longer than about 20 characters.</p>
      <p>In many cases, the solution to this kind of performance
      issue is to use an atomic group or a possessive quantifier.
      This can often reduce memory requirements as well. As another
      example, consider this pattern:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
([^&lt;]|&lt;(?!inet))+
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>It matches from wherever it starts until it encounters
      "&lt;inet" or the end of the data, and is the kind of pattern
      that might be used when processing an XML file. Each
      iteration of the outer parentheses matches either one
      character that is not "&lt;" or a "&lt;" that is not followed
      by "inet". However, each time a parenthesis is processed, a
      backtracking position is passed, so this formulation uses a
      memory frame for each matched character. For a long string, a
      lot of memory is required. Consider now this rewritten
      pattern, which matches exactly the same strings:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
([^&lt;]++|&lt;(?!inet))+
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>This runs much faster, because sequences of characters
      that do not contain "&lt;" are "swallowed" in one item inside
      the parentheses, and a possessive quantifier is used to stop
      any backtracking into the runs of non-"&lt;" characters. This
      version also uses a lot less memory because entry to a new
      set of parentheses happens only when a "&lt;" character that
      is not followed by "inet" is encountered (and we assume this
      is relatively rare).</p>
      <p>This example shows that one way of optimizing performance
      when matching long subject strings is to write repeated
      parenthesized subpatterns to match more than one character
      whenever possible.</p>

        <h3>SETTING RESOURCE LIMITS</h3>
        <p>You can set limits on the amount of processing that
        takes place when matching, and on the amount of heap memory
        that is used. The default values of the limits are very
        large, and unlikely ever to operate. They can be changed
        when PCRE2 is built, and they can also be set when
        <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() or <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>() is called. For details
        of these interfaces, see the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2build.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2build</span>(3)</span></a>
        documentation and the section entitled "The match context"
        in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2api.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2api</span>(3)</span></a>
        documentation.</p>
        <p>The <code class="function">pcre2test</code> test program
        has a modifier called "find_limits" which, if applied to a
        subject line, causes it to find the smallest limits that
        allow a pattern to match. This is done by repeatedly
        matching with different limits.</p>
