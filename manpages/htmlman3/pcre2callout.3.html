      <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
      <p>PCRE2 provides a feature called "callout", which is a
      means of temporarily passing control to the caller of PCRE2
      in the middle of pattern matching. The caller of PCRE2
      provides an external function by putting its entry point in a
      match context (see <code class="function">pcre2_set_callout</code>() in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2api.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2api</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation).</p>
      <p>When using the <code class="function">pcre2_substitute</code>() function, an additional
      callout feature is available. This does a callout after each
      change to the subject string and is described in the
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2api.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2api</span>(3)</span></a> documentation;
      the rest of this document is concerned with callouts during
      pattern matching.</p>
      <p>Within a regular expression, (?C&lt;arg&gt;) indicates a
      point at which the external function is to be called.
      Different callout points can be identified by putting a
      number less than 256 after the letter C. The default value is
      zero. Alternatively, the argument may be a delimited string.
      The starting delimiter must be one of ` ' " ^ % # $ { and the
      ending delimiter is the same as the start, except for {,
      where the ending delimiter is }. If the ending delimiter is
      needed within the string, it must be doubled. For example,
      this pattern has two callout points:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?C1)abc(?C"some ""arbitrary"" text")def
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>If the PCRE2_AUTO_CALLOUT option bit is set when a pattern
      is compiled, PCRE2 automatically inserts callouts, all with
      number 255, before each item in the pattern except for
      immediately before or after an explicit callout. For example,
      if PCRE2_AUTO_CALLOUT is used with the pattern</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
A(?C3)B
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>it is processed as if it were</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?C255)A(?C3)B(?C255)
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>Here is a more complicated example:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
A(\d{2}|--)
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>With PCRE2_AUTO_CALLOUT, this pattern is processed as if
      it were</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?C255)A(?C255)((?C255)\d{2}(?C255)|(?C255)-(?C255)-(?C255))(?C255)
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>Notice that there is a callout before and after each
      parenthesis and alternation bar. If the pattern contains a
      conditional group whose condition is an assertion, an
      automatic callout is inserted immediately before the
      condition. Such a callout may also be inserted explicitly,
      for example:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?(?C9)(?=a)ab|de)  (?(?C%text%)(?!=d)ab|de)
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>This applies only to assertion conditions (because they
      are themselves independent groups).</p>
      <p>Callouts can be useful for tracking the progress of
      pattern matching. The <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2test</span>(3)</span> program has a
      pattern qualifier (/auto_callout) that sets automatic
      callouts. When any callouts are present, the output from
      <code class="function">pcre2test</code> indicates how the
      pattern is being matched. This is useful information when you
      are trying to optimize the performance of a particular
      pattern.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="refsect1">

      <h2>MISSING CALLOUTS</h2>
      <p>You should be aware that, because of optimizations in the
      way PCRE2 compiles and matches patterns, callouts sometimes
      do not happen exactly as you might expect.</p>
      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2callout-3_sect3" name="pcre2callout-3_sect3" shape="rect"> </a>
        <h3>Auto-possessification</h3>
        <p>At compile time, PCRE2 "auto-possessifies" repeated
        items when it knows that what follows cannot be part of the
        repeat. For example, a+[bc] is compiled as if it were
        a++[bc]. The <code class="function">pcre2test</code> output
        when this pattern is compiled with PCRE2_ANCHORED and
        PCRE2_AUTO_CALLOUT and then applied to the string "aaaa"
        is:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 ---&gt;aaaa
  +0 ^        a+
  +2 ^   ^    [bc]
 No match
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>This indicates that when matching [bc] fails, there is
        no backtracking into a+ (because it is being treated as
        a++) and therefore the callouts that would be taken for the
        backtracks do not occur. You can disable the
        auto-possessify feature by passing PCRE2_NO_AUTO_POSSESS to
        <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>(), or starting
        the pattern with (*NO_AUTO_POSSESS). In this case, the
        output changes to this:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 ---&gt;aaaa
  +0 ^        a+
  +2 ^   ^    [bc]
  +2 ^  ^     [bc]
  +2 ^ ^      [bc]
  +2 ^^       [bc]
 No match
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>This time, when matching [bc] fails, the matcher
        backtracks into a+ and tries again, repeatedly, until a+
        itself fails.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2callout-3_sect4" name="pcre2callout-3_sect4" shape="rect"> </a>
        <h3>Automatic .* anchoring</h3>
        <p>By default, an optimization is applied when .* is the
        first significant item in a pattern. If PCRE2_DOTALL is
        set, so that the dot can match any character, the pattern
        is automatically anchored. If PCRE2_DOTALL is not set, a
        match can start only after an internal newline or at the
        beginning of the subject, and <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>() remembers this. If a
        pattern has more than one top-level branch, automatic
        anchoring occurs if all branches are anchorable.</p>
        <p>This optimization is disabled, however, if .* is in an
        atomic group or if there is a backreference to the capture
        group in which it appears. It is also disabled if the
        pattern contains (*PRUNE) or (*SKIP). However, the presence
        of callouts does not affect it.</p>
        <p>For example, if the pattern .*\d is compiled with
        PCRE2_AUTO_CALLOUT and applied to the string "aa", the
        <code class="function">pcre2test</code> output is:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 ---&gt;aa
  +0 ^      .*
  +2 ^ ^    \d
  +2 ^^     \d
  +2 ^      \d
 No match
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>This shows that all match attempts start at the
        beginning of the subject. In other words, the pattern is
        anchored. You can disable this optimization by passing
        PCRE2_NO_DOTSTAR_ANCHOR to <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>(), or starting the pattern
        with (*NO_DOTSTAR_ANCHOR). In this case, the output changes
        to:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 ---&gt;aa
  +0 ^      .*
  +2 ^ ^    \d
  +2 ^^     \d
  +2 ^      \d
  +0  ^     .*
  +2  ^^    \d
  +2  ^     \d
 No match
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>This shows more match attempts, starting at the second
        subject character. Another optimization, described in the
        next section, means that there is no subsequent attempt to
        match with an empty subject.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2callout-3_sect5" name="pcre2callout-3_sect5" shape="rect"> </a>
        <h3>Other optimizations</h3>
        <p>Other optimizations that provide fast "no match" results
        also affect callouts. For example, if the pattern is</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
ab(?C4)cd
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>PCRE2 knows that any matching string must contain the
        letter "d". If the subject string is "abyz", the lack of
        "d" means that matching doesn't ever start, and the callout
        is never reached. However, with "abyd", though the result
        is still no match, the callout is obeyed.</p>
        <p>For most patterns PCRE2 also knows the minimum length of
        a matching string, and will immediately give a "no match"
        return without actually running a match if the subject is
        not long enough, or, for unanchored patterns, if it has
        been scanned far enough.</p>
        <p>You can disable these optimizations by passing the
        PCRE2_NO_START_OPTIMIZE option to <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>(), or by starting the
        pattern with (*NO_START_OPT). This slows down the matching
        process, but does ensure that callouts such as the example
        above are obeyed.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>THE CALLOUT INTERFACE</h2>
      <p>During matching, when PCRE2 reaches a callout point, if an
      external function is provided in the match context, it is
      called. This applies to both normal, DFA, and JIT matching.
      The first argument to the callout function is a pointer to a
      <code class="function">pcre2_callout</code> block. The second
      argument is the void * callout data that was supplied when
      the callout was set up by calling <code class="function">pcre2_set_callout</code>() (see the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2api.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2api</span>(3)</span></a> documentation).
      The callout block structure contains the following fields,
      not necessarily in this order:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 uint32_t      <code class="function">version</code>;
 uint32_t      <code class="function">callout_number</code>;
 uint32_t      <code class="function">capture_top</code>;
 uint32_t      <code class="function">capture_last</code>;
 uint32_t      <code class="function">callout_flags</code>;
 PCRE2_SIZE   *<code class="function">offset_vector</code>;
 PCRE2_SPTR    <code class="function">mark</code>;
 PCRE2_SPTR    <code class="function">subject</code>;
 PCRE2_SIZE    <code class="function">subject_length</code>;
 PCRE2_SIZE    <code class="function">start_match</code>;
 PCRE2_SIZE    <code class="function">current_position</code>;
 PCRE2_SIZE    <code class="function">pattern_position</code>;
 PCRE2_SIZE    <code class="function">next_item_length</code>;
 PCRE2_SIZE    <code class="function">callout_string_offset</code>;
 PCRE2_SIZE    <code class="function">callout_string_length</code>;
 PCRE2_SPTR    <code class="function">callout_string</code>;
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>The <code class="function">version</code> field contains
      the version number of the block format. The current version
      is 2; the three callout string fields were added for version
      1, and the <code class="function">callout_flags</code> field
      for version 2. If you are writing an application that might
      use an earlier release of PCRE2, you should check the version
      number before accessing any of these fields. The version
      number will increase in future if more fields are added, but
      the intention is never to remove any of the existing
      fields.</p>
      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2callout-3_sect7" name="pcre2callout-3_sect7" shape="rect"> </a>
        <h3>Fields for numerical callouts</h3>
        <p>For a numerical callout, <code class="function">callout_string</code> is NULL, and <code class="function">callout_number</code> contains the number of the
        callout, in the range 0-255. This is the number that
        follows (?C for callouts that part of the pattern; it is
        255 for automatically generated callouts.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2callout-3_sect8" name="pcre2callout-3_sect8" shape="rect"> </a>
        <h3>Fields for string callouts</h3>
        <p>For callouts with string arguments, <code class="function">callout_number</code> is always zero, and
        <code class="function">callout_string</code> points to the
        string that is contained within the compiled pattern. Its
        length is given by <code class="function">callout_string_length</code>. Duplicated ending
        delimiters that were present in the original pattern string
        have been turned into single characters, but there is no
        other processing of the callout string argument. An
        additional code unit containing binary zero is present
        after the string, but is not included in the length. The
        delimiter that was used to start the string is also stored
        within the pattern, immediately before the string itself.
        You can access this delimiter as <code class="function">callout_string</code>[-1] if you need it.</p>
        <p>The <code class="function">callout_string_offset</code>
        field is the code unit offset to the start of the callout
        argument string within the original pattern string. This is
        provided for the benefit of applications such as script
        languages that might need to report errors in the callout
        string within the pattern.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2callout-3_sect9" name="pcre2callout-3_sect9" shape="rect"> </a>
        <h3>Fields for all callouts</h3>
        <p>The remaining fields in the callout block are the same
        for both kinds of callout.</p>
        <p>The <code class="function">offset_vector</code> field is
        a pointer to a vector of capturing offsets (the "ovector").
        You may read the elements in this vector, but you must not
        change any of them.</p>
        <p>For calls to <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(), the <code class="function">offset_vector</code> field is not (since release
        10.30) a pointer to the actual ovector that was passed to
        the matching function in the match data block. Instead it
        points to an internal ovector of a size large enough to
        hold all possible captured substrings in the pattern. Note
        that whenever a recursion or subroutine call within a
        pattern completes, the capturing state is reset to what it
        was before.</p>
        <p>The <code class="function">capture_last</code> field
        contains the number of the most recently captured
        substring, and the <code class="function">capture_top</code> field contains one more than
        the number of the highest numbered captured substring so
        far. If no substrings have yet been captured, the value of
        <code class="function">capture_last</code> is 0 and the
        value of <code class="function">capture_top</code> is 1.
        The values of these fields do not always differ by one; for
        example, when the callout in the pattern ((a)(b))(?C2) is
        taken, <code class="function">capture_last</code> is 1 but
        <code class="function">capture_top</code> is 4.</p>
        <p>The contents of ovector[2] to
        ovector[&lt;capture_top&gt;*2-1] can be inspected in order
        to extract substrings that have been matched so far, in the
        same way as extracting substrings after a match has
        completed. The values in ovector[0] and ovector[1] are
        always PCRE2_UNSET because the match is by definition not
        complete. Substrings that have not been captured but whose
        numbers are less than <code class="function">capture_top</code> also have both of their
        ovector slots set to PCRE2_UNSET.</p>
        <p>For DFA matching, the <code class="function">offset_vector</code> field points to the ovector
        that was passed to the matching function in the match data
        block for callouts at the top level, but to an internal
        ovector during the processing of pattern recursions,
        lookarounds, and atomic groups. However, these ovectors
        hold no useful information because <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>() does not support
        substring capturing. The value of <code class="function">capture_top</code> is always 1 and the value of
        <code class="function">capture_last</code> is always 0 for
        DFA matching.</p>
        <p>The <code class="function">subject</code> and
        <code class="function">subject_length</code> fields contain
        copies of the values that were passed to the matching
        function.</p>
        <p>The <code class="function">start_match</code> field
        normally contains the offset within the subject at which
        the current match attempt started. However, if the escape
        sequence \K has been encountered, this value is changed to
        reflect the modified starting point. If the pattern is not
        anchored, the callout function may be called several times
        from the same point in the pattern for different starting
        points in the subject.</p>
        <p>The <code class="function">current_position</code> field
        contains the offset within the subject of the current match
        pointer.</p>
        <p>The <code class="function">pattern_position</code> field
        contains the offset in the pattern string to the next item
        to be matched.</p>
        <p>The <code class="function">next_item_length</code> field
        contains the length of the next item to be processed in the
        pattern string. When the callout is at the end of the
        pattern, the length is zero. When the callout precedes an
        opening parenthesis, the length includes meta characters
        that follow the parenthesis. For example, in a callout
        before an assertion such as (?=ab) the length is 3. For an
        an alternation bar or a closing parenthesis, the length is
        one, unless a closing parenthesis is followed by a
        quantifier, in which case its length is included. (This
        changed in release 10.23. In earlier releases, before an
        opening parenthesis the length was that of the entire
        group, and before an alternation bar or a closing
        parenthesis the length was zero.)</p>
        <p>The <code class="function">pattern_position</code> and
        <code class="function">next_item_length</code> fields are
        intended to help in distinguishing between different
        automatic callouts, which all have the same callout number.
        However, they are set for all callouts, and are used by
        <code class="function">pcre2test</code> to show the next
        item to be matched when displaying callout information.</p>
        <p>In callouts from <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() the <code class="function">mark</code> field contains a pointer to the
        zero-terminated name of the most recently passed (*MARK),
        (*PRUNE), or (*THEN) item in the match, or NULL if no such
        items have been passed. Instances of (*PRUNE) or (*THEN)
        without a name do not obliterate a previous (*MARK). In
        callouts from the DFA matching function this field always
        contains NULL.</p>
        <p>The <code class="function">callout_flags</code> field is
        always zero in callouts from <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>() or when JIT is being
        used. When <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>()
        without JIT is used, the following bits may be set:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
PCRE2_CALLOUT_STARTMATCH
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>This is set for the first callout after the start of
        matching for each new starting position in the subject.</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
PCRE2_CALLOUT_BACKTRACK
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>This is set if there has been a matching backtrack since
        the previous callout, or since the start of matching if
        this is the first callout from a <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() run.</p>
        <p>Both bits are set when a backtrack has caused a
        "bumpalong" to a new starting position in the subject.
        Output from <code class="function">pcre2test</code> does
        not indicate the presence of these bits unless the
        <code class="function">callout_extra</code> modifier is
        set.</p>
        <p>The information in the <code class="function">callout_flags</code> field is provided so that
        applications can track and tell their users how matching
        with backtracking is done. This can be useful when trying
        to optimize patterns, or just to understand how PCRE2
        works. There is no support in <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>() because there is no
        backtracking in DFA matching, and there is no support in
        JIT because JIT is all about maximimizing matching
        performance. In both these cases the <code class="function">callout_flags</code> field is always zero.</p>

      <h2>RETURN VALUES FROM CALLOUTS</h2>
      <p>The external callout function returns an integer to PCRE2.
      If the value is zero, matching proceeds as normal. If the
      value is greater than zero, matching fails at the current
      point, but the testing of other matching possibilities goes
      ahead, just as if a lookahead assertion had failed. If the
      value is less than zero, the match is abandoned, and the
      matching function returns the negative value.</p>
      <p>Negative values should normally be chosen from the set of
      PCRE2_ERROR_xxx values. In particular, PCRE2_ERROR_NOMATCH
      forces a standard "no match" failure. The error number
      PCRE2_ERROR_CALLOUT is reserved for use by callout functions;
      it will never be used by PCRE2 itself.</p>

      <h2>CALLOUT ENUMERATION</h2>
      <div class="informalexample">

<span class="emphasis"><em>  int (*<code class="function">callback</code>)(pcre2_callout_enumerate_block *, void *),</em></span>

</pre>
      </div>
      <p>A script language that supports the use of string
      arguments in callouts might like to scan all the callouts in
      a pattern before running the match. This can be done by
      calling <code class="function">pcre2_callout_enumerate</code>(). The first
      argument is a pointer to a compiled pattern, the second
      points to a callback function, and the third is arbitrary
      user data. The callback function is called for every callout
      in the pattern in the order in which they appear. Its first
      argument is a pointer to a callout enumeration block, and its
      second argument is the <code class="function">user_data</code> value that was passed to
      <code class="function">pcre2_callout_enumerate</code>(). The
      data block contains the following fields:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 <code class="function">version</code>                Block version number
 <code class="function">pattern_position</code>       Offset to next item in pattern
 <code class="function">next_item_length</code>       Length of next item in pattern
 <code class="function">callout_number</code>         Number for numbered callouts
 <code class="function">callout_string_offset</code>  Offset to string within pattern
 <code class="function">callout_string_length</code>  Length of callout string
 <code class="function">callout_string</code>         Points to callout string or is NULL
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>The version number is currently 0. It will increase if new
      fields are ever added to the block. The remaining fields are
      the same as their namesakes in the <code class="function">pcre2_callout</code> block that is used for
      callouts during matching, as described above.</p>
      <p>Note that the value of <code class="function">pattern_position</code> is unique for each
      callout. However, if a callout occurs inside a group that is
      quantified with a non-zero minimum or a fixed maximum, the
      group is replicated inside the compiled pattern. For example,
      a pattern such as /(a){2}/ is compiled as if it were
      /(a)(a)/. This means that the callout will be enumerated more
      than once, but with the same value for <code class="function">pattern_position</code> in each case.</p>
      <p>The callback function should normally return zero. If it
      returns a non-zero value, scanning the pattern stops, and
      that value is returned from <code class="function">pcre2_callout_enumerate</code>().</p>
