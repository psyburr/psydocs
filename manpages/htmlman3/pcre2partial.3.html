      <h2>PARTIAL MATCHING IN PCRE2</h2>
      <p>In normal use of PCRE2, if there is a match up to the end
      of a subject string, but more characters are needed to match
      the entire pattern, PCRE2_ERROR_NOMATCH is returned, just
      like any other failing match. There are circumstances where
      it might be helpful to distinguish this "partial match"
      case.</p>
      <p>One example is an application where the subject string is
      very long, and not all available at once. The requirement
      here is to be able to do the matching segment by segment, but
      special action is needed when a matched substring spans the
      boundary between two segments.</p>
      <p>Another example is checking a user input string as it is
      typed, to ensure that it conforms to a required format.
      Invalid characters can be immediately diagnosed and rejected,
      giving instant feedback.</p>
      <p>Partial matching is a PCRE2-specific feature; it is not
      Perl-compatible. It is requested by setting one of the
      PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD or PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT options when calling
      a matching function. The difference between the two options
      is whether or not a partial match is preferred to an
      alternative complete match, though the details differ between
      the two types of matching function. If both options are set,
      PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD takes precedence.</p>
      <p>If you want to use partial matching with just-in-time
      optimized code, as well as setting a partial match option for
      the matching function, you must also call <code class="function">pcre2_jit_compile</code>() with one or both of
      these options:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 PCRE2_JIT_PARTIAL_HARD
 PCRE2_JIT_PARTIAL_SOFT
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>PCRE2_JIT_COMPLETE should also be set if you are going to
      run non-partial matches on the same pattern. Separate code is
      compiled for each mode. If the appropriate JIT mode has not
      been compiled, interpretive matching code is used.</p>
      <p>Setting a partial matching option disables two of PCRE2's
      standard optimization hints. PCRE2 remembers the last literal
      code unit in a pattern, and abandons matching immediately if
      it is not present in the subject string. This optimization
      cannot be used for a subject string that might match only
      partially. PCRE2 also remembers a minimum length of a
      matching string, and does not bother to run the matching
      function on shorter strings. This optimization is also
      disabled for partial matching.</p>

      <h2>REQUIREMENTS FOR A PARTIAL MATCH</h2>
      <p>A possible partial match occurs during matching when the
      end of the subject string is reached successfully, but either
      more characters are needed to complete the match, or the
      addition of more characters might change what is matched.</p>
      <p>Example 1: if the pattern is /abc/ and the subject is
      "ab", more characters are definitely needed to complete a
      match. In this case both hard and soft matching options yield
      a partial match.</p>
      <p>Example 2: if the pattern is /ab+/ and the subject is
      "ab", a complete match can be found, but the addition of more
      characters might change what is matched. In this case, only
      PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD returns a partial match;
      PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT returns the complete match.</p>
      <p>On reaching the end of the subject, when
      PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD is set, if the next pattern item is \z,
      \Z, \b, \B, or $ there is always a partial match. Otherwise,
      for both options, the next pattern item must be one that
      inspects a character, and at least one of the following must
      be true:</p>
      <p>(1) At least one character has already been inspected. An
      inspected character need not form part of the final matched
      string; lookbehind assertions and the \K escape sequence
      provide ways of inspecting characters before the start of a
      matched string.</p>
      <p>(2) The pattern contains one or more lookbehind
      assertions. This condition exists in case there is a
      lookbehind that inspects characters before the start of the
      match.</p>
      <p>(3) There is a special case when the whole pattern can
      match an empty string. When the starting point is at the end
      of the subject, the empty string match is a possibility, and
      if PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT is set and neither of the above
      conditions is true, it is returned. However, because adding
      more characters might result in a non-empty match,
      PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD returns a partial match, which in this
      case means "there is going to be a match at this point, but
      until some more characters are added, we do not know if it
      will be an empty string or something longer".</p>

      <h2>PARTIAL MATCHING USING pcre2_match()</h2>
      <p>When a partial matching option is set, the result of
      calling <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() can be
      one of the following:</p>
      <div class="variablelist">
        <dl class="variablelist">
          <dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>A
          successful match</em></span></span></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>A complete match has been found, starting and ending
            within this subject.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt><span class="term"><code class="constant">PCRE2_ERROR_NOMATCH</code></span></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>No match can start anywhere in this subject.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt><span class="term"><code class="constant">PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL</code></span></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Adding more characters may result in a complete
            match that uses one or more characters from the end of
            this subject.</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </div>
      <p>When a partial match is returned, the first two elements
      in the ovector point to the portion of the subject that was
      matched, but the values in the rest of the ovector are
      undefined. The appearance of \K in the pattern has no effect
      for a partial match. Consider this pattern:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/abc\K123/
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>If it is matched against "456abc123xyz" the result is a
      complete match, and the ovector defines the matched string as
      "123", because \K resets the "start of match" point. However,
      if a partial match is requested and the subject string is
      "456abc12", a partial match is found for the string "abc12",
      because all these characters are needed for a subsequent
      re-match with additional characters.</p>
      <p>If there is more than one partial match, the first one
      that was found provides the data that is returned. Consider
      this pattern:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/123\w+X|dogY/
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>If this is matched against the subject string "abc123dog",
      both alternatives fail to match, but the end of the subject
      is reached during matching, so PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL is
      returned. The offsets are set to 3 and 9, identifying
      "123dog" as the first partial match. (In this example, there
      are two partial matches, because "dog" on its own partially
      matches the second alternative.)</p>
      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2partial-3_sect4" name="pcre2partial-3_sect4" shape="rect"> </a>
        <h3>How a partial match is processed by pcre2_match()</h3>
        <p>What happens when a partial match is identified depends
        on which of the two partial matching options is set.</p>
        <p>If PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD is set, PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL is
        returned as soon as a partial match is found, without
        continuing to search for possible complete matches. This
        option is "hard" because it prefers an earlier partial
        match over a later complete match. For this reason, the
        assumption is made that the end of the supplied subject
        string is not the true end of the available data, which is
        why \z, \Z, \b, \B, and $ always give a partial match.</p>
        <p>If PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT is set, the partial match is
        remembered, but matching continues as normal, and other
        alternatives in the pattern are tried. If no complete match
        can be found, PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL is returned instead of
        PCRE2_ERROR_NOMATCH. This option is "soft" because it
        prefers a complete match over a partial match. All the
        various matching items in a pattern behave as if the
        subject string is potentially complete; \z, \Z, and $ match
        at the end of the subject, as normal, and for \b and \B the
        end of the subject is treated as a non-alphanumeric.</p>
        <p>The difference between the two partial matching options
        can be illustrated by a pattern such as:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/dog(sbody)?/
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>This matches either "dog" or "dogsbody", greedily (that
        is, it prefers the longer string if possible). If it is
        matched against the string "dog" with PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT,
        it yields a complete match for "dog". However, if
        PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD is set, the result is
        PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL. On the other hand, if the pattern is
        made ungreedy the result is different:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/dog(sbody)??/
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>In this case the result is always a complete match
        because that is found first, and matching never continues
        after finding a complete match. It might be easier to
        follow this explanation by thinking of the two patterns
        like this:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 /dog(sbody)?/    is the same as  /dogsbody|dog/
 /dog(sbody)??/   is the same as  /dog|dogsbody/
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>The second pattern will never match "dogsbody", because
        it will always find the shorter match first.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="refsect2">

        <h3>Example of partial matching using pcre2test</h3>
        <p>The <code class="function">pcre2test</code> data
        modifiers <code class="function">partial_hard</code> (or
        <code class="function">ph</code>) and <code class="function">partial_soft</code> (or <code class="function">ps</code>) set PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD and
        PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT, respectively, when calling <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(). Here is a run of
        <code class="function">pcre2test</code> using a pattern
        that matches the whole subject in the form of a date:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$/
 data&gt; 25dec3\=ph
 Partial match: 23dec3
 data&gt; 3ju\=ph
 Partial match: 3ju
 data&gt; 3juj\=ph
 No match
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>This example gives the same results for both hard and
        soft partial matching options. Here is an example where
        there is a difference:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$/
 data&gt; 25jun04\=ps
  0: 25jun04
  1: jun
 data&gt; 25jun04\=ph
 Partial match: 25jun04
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>With PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT, the subject is matched
        completely. For PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD, however, the subject is
        assumed not to be complete, so there is only a partial
        match.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2partial-3_sect6" name="pcre2partial-3_sect6" shape="rect"> </a>
      <h2>MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING WITH pcre2_match()</h2>
      <p>PCRE was not originally designed with multi-segment
      matching in mind. However, over time, features (including
      partial matching) that make multi-segment matching possible
      have been added. A very long string can be searched segment
      by segment by calling <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() repeatedly, with the aim of
      achieving the same results that would happen if the entire
      string was available for searching all the time. Normally,
      the strings that are being sought are much shorter than each
      individual segment, and are in the middle of very long
      strings, so the pattern is normally not anchored.</p>
      <p>Special logic must be implemented to handle a matched
      substring that spans a segment boundary. PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD
      should be used, because it returns a partial match at the end
      of a segment whenever there is the possibility of changing
      the match by adding more characters. The PCRE2_NOTBOL option
      should also be set for all but the first segment.</p>
      <p>When a partial match occurs, the next segment must be
      added to the current subject and the match re-run, using the
      <code class="function">startoffset</code> argument of
      <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() to begin at the
      point where the partial match started. For example:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d/
 data&gt; ...the date is 23ja\=ph
 Partial match: 23ja
 data&gt; ...the date is 23jan19 and on that day...\=offset=15
  0: 23jan19
  1: jan
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>Note the use of the <code class="function">offset</code>
      modifier to start the new match where the partial match was
      found. In this example, the next segment was added to the one
      in which the partial match was found. This is the most
      straightforward approach, typically using a memory buffer
      that is twice the size of each segment. After a partial
      match, the first half of the buffer is discarded, the second
      half is moved to the start of the buffer, and a new segment
      is added before repeating the match as in the example above.
      After a no match, the entire buffer can be discarded.</p>
      <p>If there are memory constraints, you may want to discard
      text that precedes a partial match before adding the next
      segment. Unfortunately, this is not at present
      straightforward. In cases such as the above, where the
      pattern does not contain any lookbehinds, it is sufficient to
      retain only the partially matched substring. However, if the
      pattern contains a lookbehind assertion, characters that
      precede the start of the partial match may have been
      inspected during the matching process. When <code class="function">pcre2test</code> displays a partial match, it
      indicates these characters with '&lt;' if the <code class="function">allusedtext</code> modifier is set:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; "(?&lt;=123)abc"
 data&gt; xx123ab\=ph,allusedtext
 Partial match: 123ab
                &lt;&lt;&lt;
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>However, the <code class="function">allusedtext</code>
      modifier is not available for JIT matching, because JIT
      matching does not record the first (or last) consulted
      characters. For this reason, this information is not
      available via the API. It is therefore not possible in
      general to obtain the exact number of characters that must be
      retained in order to get the right match result. If you
      cannot retain the entire segment, you must find some
      heuristic way of choosing.</p>
      <p>If you know the approximate length of the matching
      substrings, you can use that to decide how much text to
      retain. The only lookbehind information that is currently
      available via the API is the length of the longest individual
      lookbehind in a pattern, but this can be misleading if there
      are nested lookbehinds. The value returned by calling
      <code class="function">pcre2_pattern_info</code>() with the
      PCRE2_INFO_MAXLOOKBEHIND option is the maximum number of
      characters (not code units) that any individual lookbehind
      moves back when it is processed. A pattern such as
      "(?&lt;=(?&lt;!b)a)" has a maximum lookbehind value of one,
      but inspects two characters before its starting point.</p>
      <p>In a non-UTF or a 32-bit case, moving back is just a
      subtraction, but in UTF-8 or UTF-16 you have to count
      characters while moving back through the code units.</p>

      <h2>PARTIAL MATCHING USING pcre2_dfa_match()</h2>
      <p>The DFA function moves along the subject string character
      by character, without backtracking, searching for all
      possible matches simultaneously. If the end of the subject is
      reached before the end of the pattern, there is the
      possibility of a partial match.</p>
      <p>When PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT is set, PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL is
      returned only if there have been no complete matches.
      Otherwise, the complete matches are returned. If
      PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD is set, a partial match takes precedence
      over any complete matches. The portion of the string that was
      matched when the longest partial match was found is set as
      the first matching string.</p>
      <p>Because the DFA function always searches for all possible
      matches, and there is no difference between greedy and
      ungreedy repetition, its behaviour is different from the
      <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(). Consider the
      string "dog" matched against this ungreedy pattern:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/dog(sbody)??/
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>Whereas the standard function stops as soon as it finds
      the complete match for "dog", the DFA function also finds the
      partial match for "dogsbody", and so returns that when
      PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD is set.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2partial-3_sect8" name="pcre2partial-3_sect8" shape="rect"> </a>
      <h2>MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING WITH pcre2_dfa_match()</h2>
      <p>When a partial match has been found using the DFA matching
      function, it is possible to continue the match by providing
      additional subject data and calling the function again with
      the same compiled regular expression, this time setting the
      PCRE2_DFA_RESTART option. You must pass the same working
      space as before, because this is where details of the
      previous partial match are stored. You can set the
      PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT or PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD options with
      PCRE2_DFA_RESTART to continue partial matching over multiple
      segments. Here is an example using <code class="function">pcre2test</code>:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$/
 data&gt; 23ja\=dfa,ps
 Partial match: 23ja
 data&gt; n05\=dfa,dfa_restart
  0: n05
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>The first call has "23ja" as the subject, and requests
      partial matching; the second call has "n05" as the subject
      for the continued (restarted) match. Notice that when the
      match is complete, only the last part is shown; PCRE2 does
      not retain the previously partially-matched string. It is up
      to the calling program to do that if it needs to. This means
      that, for an unanchored pattern, if a continued match fails,
      it is not possible to try again at a new starting point. All
      this facility is capable of doing is continuing with the
      previous match attempt. For example, consider this

      <p>If the first part of the subject is "ABC123", a partial
      match of the first alternative is found at offset 3. There is
      no partial match for the second alternative, because such a
      match does not start at the same point in the subject string.
      Attempting to continue with the string "7890" does not yield
      a match because only those alternatives that match at one
      point in the subject are remembered. Depending on the
      application, this may or may not be what you want.</p>
      <p>If you do want to allow for starting again at the next
      character, one way of doing it is to retain some or all of
      the segment and try a new complete match, as described for
      <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() above. Another
      possibility is to work with two buffers. If a partial match
      at offset <code class="literal">n</code> in the first buffer
      is followed by "no match" when PCRE2_DFA_RESTART is used on
      the second buffer, you can then try a new match starting at
      offset <em class="replaceable"><code>n+1</code></em> in the
      first buffer.</p>
