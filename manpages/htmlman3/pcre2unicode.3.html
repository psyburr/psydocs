      <h2>UNICODE AND UTF SUPPORT</h2>
      <p>PCRE2 is normally built with Unicode support, though if
      you do not need it, you can build it without, in which case
      the library will be smaller. With Unicode support, PCRE2 has
      knowledge of Unicode character properties and can process
      strings of text in UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 format
      (depending on the code unit width), but this is not the
      default. Unless specifically requested, PCRE2 treats each
      code unit in a string as one character.</p>
      <p>There are two ways of telling PCRE2 to switch to UTF mode,
      where characters may consist of more than one code unit and
      the range of values is constrained. The program can call
      <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2_compile()</span>(3)</span> with the
      PCRE2_UTF option, or the pattern may start with the sequence
      (*UTF). However, the latter facility can be locked out by the
      PCRE2_NEVER_UTF option. That is, the programmer can prevent
      the supplier of the pattern from switching to UTF mode.</p>
      <p>Note that the PCRE2_MATCH_INVALID_UTF option (see below)
      forces PCRE2_UTF to be set.</p>
      <p>In UTF mode, both the pattern and any subject strings that
      are matched against it are treated as UTF strings instead of
      strings of individual one-code-unit characters. There are
      also some other changes to the way characters are handled, as
      documented below.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="refsect1">

      <h2>UNICODE PROPERTY SUPPORT</h2>
      <p>When PCRE2 is built with Unicode support, the escape
      sequences \p{..}, \P{..}, and \X can be used. This is not
      dependent on the PCRE2_UTF setting. The Unicode properties
      that can be tested are limited to the general category
      properties such as Lu for an upper case letter or Nd for a
      decimal number, the Unicode script names such as Arabic or
      Han, and the derived properties Any and L&amp;. Full lists
      are given in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2pattern.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2pattern</span>(3)</span></a> and
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2syntax.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2syntax</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation. Only the short names for properties are
      supported. For example, \p{L} matches a letter. Its Perl
      synonym, \p{Letter}, is not supported. Furthermore, in Perl,
      many properties may optionally be prefixed by "Is", for
      compatibility with Perl 5.6. PCRE2 does not support this.</p>

      <h2>WIDE CHARACTERS AND UTF MODES</h2>
      <p>Code points less than 256 can be specified in patterns by
      either braced or unbraced hexadecimal escape sequences (for
      example, \x{b3} or \xb3). Larger values have to use braced
      sequences. Unbraced octal code points up to \777 are also
      recognized; larger ones can be coded using \o{...}.</p>
      <p>The escape sequence \N{U+&lt;hex digits&gt;} is recognized
      as another way of specifying a Unicode character by code
      point in a UTF mode. It is not allowed in non-UTF mode.</p>
      <p>In UTF mode, repeat quantifiers apply to complete UTF
      characters, not to individual code units.</p>
      <p>In UTF mode, the dot metacharacter matches one UTF
      character instead of a single code unit.</p>
      <p>In UTF mode, capture group names are not restricted to
      ASCII, and may contain any Unicode letters and decimal
      digits, as well as underscore.</p>
      <p>The escape sequence \C can be used to match a single code
      unit in UTF mode, but its use can lead to some strange
      effects because it breaks up multi-unit characters (see the
      description of \C in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2pattern.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2pattern</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation). For this reason, there is a build-time option
      that disables support for \C completely. There is also a less
      draconian compile-time option for locking out the use of \C
      when a pattern is compiled.</p>
      <p>The use of \C is not supported by the alternative matching
      function <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>() when
      in UTF-8 or UTF-16 mode, that is, when a character may
      consist of more than one code unit. The use of \C in these
      modes provokes a match-time error. Also, the JIT optimization
      does not support \C in these modes. If JIT optimization is
      requested for a UTF-8 or UTF-16 pattern that contains \C, it
      will not succeed, and so when <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() is called, the matching will
      be carried out by the interpretive function.</p>
      <p>The character escapes \b, \B, \d, \D, \s, \S, \w, and \W
      correctly test characters of any code value, but, by default,
      the characters that PCRE2 recognizes as digits, spaces, or
      word characters remain the same set as in non-UTF mode, all
      with code points less than 256. This remains true even when
      PCRE2 is built to include Unicode support, because to do
      otherwise would slow down matching in many common cases. Note
      that this also applies to \b and \B, because they are defined
      in terms of \w and \W. If you want to test for a wider sense
      of, say, "digit", you can use explicit Unicode property tests
      such as \p{Nd}. Alternatively, if you set the PCRE2_UCP
      option, the way that the character escapes work is changed so
      that Unicode properties are used to determine which
      characters match. There are more details in the section on
      generic character types in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2pattern.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2pattern</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation.</p>
      <p>Similarly, characters that match the POSIX named character
      classes are all low-valued characters, unless the PCRE2_UCP
      option is set.</p>
      <p>However, the special horizontal and vertical white space
      matching escapes (\h, \H, \v, and \V) do match all the
      appropriate Unicode characters, whether or not PCRE2_UCP is
      set.</p>

      <h2>UNICODE CASE-EQUIVALENCE</h2>
      <p>If either PCRE2_UTF or PCRE2_UCP is set, upper/lower case
      processing makes use of Unicode properties except for
      characters whose code points are less than 128 and that have
      at most two case-equivalent values. For these, a direct table
      lookup is used for speed. A few Unicode characters such as
      Greek sigma have more than two code points that are
      case-equivalent, and these are treated specially. Setting
      PCRE2_UCP without PCRE2_UTF allows Unicode-style case
      processing for non-UTF character encodings such as UCS-2.</p>

      <h2>SCRIPT RUNS</h2>
      <p>The pattern constructs (*script_run:...) and
      (*atomic_script_run:...), with synonyms (*sr:...) and
      (*asr:...), verify that the string matched within the
      parentheses is a script run. In concept, a script run is a
      sequence of characters that are all from the same Unicode
      script. However, because some scripts are commonly used
      together, and because some diacritical and other marks are
      used with multiple scripts, it is not that simple.</p>
      <p>Every Unicode character has a Script property, mostly with
      a value corresponding to the name of a script, such as Latin,
      Greek, or Cyrillic. There are also three special values:</p>
      <p>"Unknown" is used for code points that have not been
      assigned, and also for the surrogate code points. In the
      PCRE2 32-bit library, characters whose code points are
      greater than the Unicode maximum (U+10FFFF), which are
      accessible only in non-UTF mode, are assigned the Unknown
      script.</p>
      <p>"Common" is used for characters that are used with many
      scripts. These include punctuation, emoji, mathematical,
      musical, and currency symbols, and the ASCII digits 0 to
      9.</p>
      <p>"Inherited" is used for characters such as diacritical
      marks that modify a previous character. These are considered
      to take on the script of the character that they modify.</p>
      <p>Some Inherited characters are used with many scripts, but
      many of them are only normally used with a small number of
      scripts. For example, U+102E0 (Coptic Epact thousands mark)
      is used only with Arabic and Coptic. In order to make it
      possible to check this, a Unicode property called Script
      Extension exists. Its value is a list of scripts that apply
      to the character. For the majority of characters, the list
      contains just one script, the same one as the Script
      property. However, for characters such as U+102E0 more than
      one Script is listed. There are also some Common characters
      that have a single, non-Common script in their Script
      Extension list.</p>
      <p>The next section describes the basic rules for deciding
      whether a given string of characters is a script run. Note,
      however, that there are some special cases involving the
      Chinese Han script, and an additional constraint for decimal
      digits. These are covered in subsequent sections.</p>
      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2unicode-3_sect6" name="pcre2unicode-3_sect6" shape="rect"> </a>
        <h3>Basic script run rules</h3>
        <p>A string that is less than two characters long is a
        script run. This is the only case in which an Unknown
        character can be part of a script run. Longer strings are
        checked using only the Script Extensions property, not the
        basic Script property.</p>
        <p>If a character's Script Extension property is the single
        value "Inherited", it is always accepted as part of a
        script run. This is also true for the property "Common",
        subject to the checking of decimal digits described below.
        All the remaining characters in a script run must have at
        least one script in common in their Script Extension lists.
        In set-theoretic terminology, the intersection of all the
        sets of scripts must not be empty.</p>
        <p>A simple example is an Internet name such as
        "google.com". The letters are all in the Latin script, and
        the dot is Common, so this string is a script run. However,
        the Cyrillic letter "o" looks exactly the same as the Latin
        "o"; a string that looks the same, but with Cyrillic "o"s
        is not a script run.</p>
        <p>More interesting examples involve characters with more
        than one script in their Script Extension. Consider the
        following characters:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 U+060C  Arabic comma
 U+06D4  Arabic full stop
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>The first has the Script Extension list Arabic, Hanifi
        Rohingya, Syriac, and Thaana; the second has just Arabic
        and Hanifi Rohingya. Both of them could appear in script
        runs of either Arabic or Hanifi Rohingya. The first could
        also appear in Syriac or Thaana script runs, but the second
        could not.</p>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2unicode-3_sect7" name="pcre2unicode-3_sect7" shape="rect"> </a>
        <h3>The Chinese Han script</h3>
        <p>The Chinese Han script is commonly used in conjunction
        with other scripts for writing certain languages. Japanese
        uses the Hiragana and Katakana scripts together with Han;
        Korean uses Hangul and Han; Taiwanese Mandarin uses
        Bopomofo and Han. These three combinations are treated as
        special cases when checking script runs and are, in effect,
        "virtual scripts". Thus, a script run may contain a mixture
        of Hiragana, Katakana, and Han, or a mixture of Hangul and
        Han, or a mixture of Bopomofo and Han, but not, for
        example, a mixture of Hangul and Bopomofo and Han. PCRE2
        (like Perl) follows Unicode's Technical Standard 39
        ("Unicode Security Mechanisms",
        http://unicode.org/reports/tr39/) in allowing such
        mixtures.</p>

        <h3>Decimal digits</h3>
        <p>Unicode contains many sets of 10 decimal digits in
        different scripts, and some scripts (including the Common
        script) contain more than one set. Some of these decimal
        digits them are visually indistinguishable from the common
        ASCII digits. In addition to the script checking described
        above, if a script run contains any decimal digits, they
        must all come from the same set of 10 adjacent
        characters.</p>

      <h2>VALIDITY OF UTF STRINGS</h2>
      <p>When the PCRE2_UTF option is set, the strings passed as
      patterns and subjects are (by default) checked for validity
      on entry to the relevant functions. If an invalid UTF string
      is passed, a negative error code is returned. The code unit
      offset to the offending character can be extracted from the
      match data block by calling <code class="function">pcre2_get_startchar</code>(), which is used for
      this purpose after a UTF error.</p>
      <p>In some situations, you may already know that your strings
      are valid, and therefore want to skip these checks in order
      to improve performance, for example in the case of a long
      subject string that is being scanned repeatedly. If you set
      the PCRE2_NO_UTF_CHECK option at compile time or at match
      time, PCRE2 assumes that the pattern or subject it is given
      (respectively) contains only valid UTF code unit
      sequences.</p>
      <p>If you pass an invalid UTF string when PCRE2_NO_UTF_CHECK
      is set, the result is undefined and your program may crash or
      loop indefinitely or give incorrect results. There is,
      however, one mode of matching that can handle invalid UTF
      subject strings. This is enabled by passing
      PCRE2_MATCH_INVALID_UTF to <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>() and is discussed below in
      the next section. The rest of this section covers the case
      when PCRE2_MATCH_INVALID_UTF is not set.</p>
      <p>Passing PCRE2_NO_UTF_CHECK to <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>() just disables the UTF check
      for the pattern; it does not also apply to subject strings.
      If you want to disable the check for a subject string you
      must pass this same option to <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() or <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>().</p>
      <p>UTF-16 and UTF-32 strings can indicate their endianness by
      special code knows as a byte-order mark (BOM). The PCRE2
      functions do not handle this, expecting strings to be in host
      byte order.</p>
      <p>Unless PCRE2_NO_UTF_CHECK is set, a UTF string is checked
      before any other processing takes place. In the case of
      <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() and <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>() calls with a non-zero
      starting offset, the check is applied only to that part of
      the subject that could be inspected during matching, and
      there is a check that the starting offset points to the first
      code unit of a character or to the end of the subject. If
      there are no lookbehind assertions in the pattern, the check
      starts at the starting offset. Otherwise, it starts at the
      length of the longest lookbehind before the starting offset,
      or at the start of the subject if there are not that many
      characters before the starting offset. Note that the
      sequences \b and \B are one-character lookbehinds.</p>
      <p>In addition to checking the format of the string, there is
      a check to ensure that all code points lie in the range U+0
      to U+10FFFF, excluding the surrogate area. The so-called
      "non-character" code points are not excluded because Unicode
      corrigendum #9 makes it clear that they should not be.</p>
      <p>Characters in the "Surrogate Area" of Unicode are reserved
      for use by UTF-16, where they are used in pairs to encode
      code points with values greater than 0xFFFF. The code points
      that are encoded by UTF-16 pairs are available independently
      in the UTF-8 and UTF-32 encodings. (In other words, the whole
      surrogate thing is a fudge for UTF-16 which unfortunately
      messes up UTF-8 and UTF-32.)</p>
      <p>Setting PCRE2_NO_UTF_CHECK at compile time does not
      disable the error that is given if an escape sequence for an
      invalid Unicode code point is encountered in the pattern. If
      you want to allow escape sequences such as \x{d800} (a
      surrogate code point) you can set the
      PCRE2_EXTRA_ALLOW_SURROGATE_ESCAPES extra option. However,
      this is possible only in UTF-8 and UTF-32 modes, because
      these values are not representable in UTF-16.</p>

      <h2>MATCHING IN INVALID UTF STRINGS</h2>
      <p>You can run pattern matches on subject strings that may
      contain invalid UTF sequences if you call <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>() with the
      PCRE2_MATCH_INVALID_UTF option. This is supported by
      <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(), including JIT
      matching, but not by <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>(). When
      PCRE2_MATCH_INVALID_UTF is set, it forces PCRE2_UTF to be set
      as well. Note, however, that the pattern itself must be a
      valid UTF string.</p>
      <p>Setting PCRE2_MATCH_INVALID_UTF does not affect what
      <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>() generates, but
      if <code class="function">pcre2_jit_compile</code>() is
      subsequently called, it does generate different code. If JIT
      is not used, the option affects the behaviour of the
      interpretive code in <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(). When PCRE2_MATCH_INVALID_UTF
      is set at compile time, PCRE2_NO_UTF_CHECK is ignored at
      match time.</p>
      <p>In this mode, an invalid code unit sequence in the subject
      never matches any pattern item. It does not match dot, it
      does not match \p{Any}, it does not even match negative items
      such as [^X]. A lookbehind assertion fails if it encounters
      an invalid sequence while moving the current point backwards.
      In other words, an invalid UTF code unit sequence acts as a
      barrier which no match can cross.</p>
      <p>You can also think of this as the subject being split up
      into fragments of valid UTF, delimited internally by invalid
      code unit sequences. The pattern is matched fragment by
      fragment. The result of a successful match, however, is given
      as code unit offsets in the entire subject string in the
      usual way. There are a few points to consider:</p>
      <p>The internal boundaries are not interpreted as the
      beginnings or ends of lines and so do not match circumflex or
      dollar characters in the pattern.</p>
      <p>If <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() is called
      with an offset that points to an invalid UTF-sequence, that
      sequence is skipped, and the match starts at the next valid
      UTF character, or the end of the subject.</p>
      <p>At internal fragment boundaries, \b and \B behave in the
      same way as at the beginning and end of the subject. For
      example, a sequence such as \bWORD\b would match an instance
      of WORD that is surrounded by invalid UTF code units.</p>
      <p>Using PCRE2_MATCH_INVALID_UTF, an application can run
      matches on arbitrary data, knowing that any matched strings
      that are returned are valid UTF. This can be useful when
      searching for UTF text in executable or other binary
      files.</p>
