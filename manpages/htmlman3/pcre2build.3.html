      <h2>BUILDING PCRE2</h2>
      <p>PCRE2 is distributed with a <code class="function">configure</code> script that can be used to build
      the library in Unix-like environments using the applications
      known as Autotools. Also in the distribution are files to
      support building using <code class="function">CMake</code>
      instead of <code class="function">configure</code>. The text
      file <code class="constant">README</code> contains general
      information about building with Autotools (some of which is
      repeated below), and also has some comments about building on
      various operating systems. There is a lot more information
      about building PCRE2 without using Autotools (including
      information about using <code class="function">CMake</code>
      and building "by hand") in the text file called <em class="replaceable"><code>NON-AUTOTOOLS-BUILD</code></em>. You
      should consult this file as well as the <code class="constant">README</code> file if you are building in a
      non-Unix-like environment.</p>

      <h2>PCRE2 BUILD-TIME OPTIONS</h2>
      <p>The rest of this document describes the optional features
      of PCRE2 that can be selected when the library is compiled.
      It assumes use of the <code class="function">configure</code>
      script, where the optional features are selected or
      deselected by providing options to <code class="function">configure</code> before running the <code class="function">make</code> command. However, the same options can
      be selected in both Unix-like and non-Unix-like environments
      if you are using <code class="function">CMake</code> instead
      of <code class="function">configure</code> to build
      PCRE2.</p>
      <p>If you are not using Autotools or <code class="function">CMake</code>, option selection can be done by
      editing the <code class="filename">config.h</code> file, or
      by passing parameter settings to the compiler, as described
      in <em class="replaceable"><code>NON-AUTOTOOLS-BUILD</code></em>.</p>
      <p>The complete list of options for <code class="function">configure</code> (which includes the standard ones
      such as the selection of the installation directory) can be
      obtained by running</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
./configure --help
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>The following sections include descriptions of "on/off"
      options whose names begin with --enable or --disable. Because
      of the way that <code class="function">configure</code>
      works, --enable and --disable always come in pairs, so the
      complementary option always exists as well, but as it
      specifies the default, it is not described. Options that
      specify values have names that start with --with. At the end
      of a <code class="function">configure</code> run, a summary
      of the configuration is output.</p>

      <h2>BUILDING 8-BIT, 16-BIT AND 32-BIT LIBRARIES</h2>
      <p>By default, a library called <em class="replaceable"><code>libpcre2-8</code></em> is built,
      containing functions that take string arguments contained in
      arrays of bytes, interpreted either as single-byte
      characters, or UTF-8 strings. You can also build two other
      libraries, called <em class="replaceable"><code>libpcre2-16</code></em> and <em class="replaceable"><code>libpcre2-32</code></em>, which process
      strings that are contained in arrays of 16-bit and 32-bit
      code units, respectively. These can be interpreted either as
      single-unit characters or UTF-16/UTF-32 strings. To build
      these additional libraries, add one or both of the following
      to the <code class="function">configure</code> command:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 --enable-pcre2-16
 --enable-pcre2-32
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>If you do not want the 8-bit library, add</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--disable-pcre2-8
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>as well. At least one of the three libraries must be
      built. Note that the POSIX wrapper is for the 8-bit library
      only, and that <code class="function">pcre2grep</code> is an
      8-bit program. Neither of these are built if you select only
      the 16-bit or 32-bit libraries.</p>

      <h2>BUILDING SHARED AND STATIC LIBRARIES</h2>
      <p>The Autotools PCRE2 building process uses <code class="function">libtool</code> to build both shared and static
      libraries by default. You can suppress an unwanted library by
      adding one of</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 --disable-shared
 --disable-static
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code>
      command.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2build-3_sect5" name="pcre2build-3_sect5" shape="rect"> </a>
      <h2>UNICODE AND UTF SUPPORT</h2>
      <p>By default, PCRE2 is built with support for Unicode and
      UTF character strings. To build it without Unicode support,
      add</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--disable-unicode
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command.
      This setting applies to all three libraries. It is not
      possible to build one library with Unicode support and
      another without in the same configuration.</p>
      <p>Of itself, Unicode support does not make PCRE2 treat
      strings as UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32. To do that, applications
      that use the library can set the PCRE2_UTF option when they
      call <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>() to compile
      a pattern. Alternatively, patterns may be started with (*UTF)
      unless the application has locked this out by setting
      PCRE2_NEVER_UTF.</p>
      <p>UTF support allows the libraries to process character code
      points up to 0x10ffff in the strings that they handle.
      Unicode support also gives access to the Unicode properties
      of characters, using pattern escapes such as \P, \p, and \X.
      Only the general category properties such as <code class="function">Lu</code> and <code class="function">Nd</code> are
      supported. Details are given in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2pattern.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2pattern</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation.</p>
      <p>Pattern escapes such as \d and \w do not by default make
      use of Unicode properties. The application can request that
      they do by setting the PCRE2_UCP option. Unless the
      application has set PCRE2_NEVER_UCP, a pattern may also
      request this by starting with (*UCP).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2build-3_sect6" name="pcre2build-3_sect6" shape="rect"> </a>
      <h2>DISABLING THE USE OF \C</h2>
      <p>The \C escape sequence, which matches a single code unit,
      even in a UTF mode, can cause unpredictable behaviour because
      it may leave the current matching point in the middle of a
      multi-code-unit character. The application can lock it out by
      setting the PCRE2_NEVER_BACKSLASH_C option when calling
      <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>(). There is also
      a build-time option</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-never-backslash-C
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>(note the upper case C) which locks out the use of \C
      entirely.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2build-3_sect7" name="pcre2build-3_sect7" shape="rect"> </a>
      <h2>JUST-IN-TIME COMPILER SUPPORT</h2>
      <p>Just-in-time (JIT) compiler support is included in the
      build by specifying</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-jit
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>This support is available only for certain hardware
      architectures. If this option is set for an unsupported
      architecture, a building error occurs. If in doubt, use</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-jit=auto
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>which enables JIT only if the current hardware is
      supported. You can check if JIT is enabled in the
      configuration summary that is output at the end of a
      <code class="function">configure</code> run. If you are
      enabling JIT under SELinux you may also want to add</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-jit-sealloc
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>which enables the use of an execmem allocator in JIT that
      is compatible with SELinux. This has no effect if JIT is not
      enabled. See the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2jit.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2jit</span>(3)</span></a> documentation
      for a discussion of JIT usage. When JIT support is enabled,
      <code class="function">pcre2grep</code> automatically makes
      use of it, unless you add</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--disable-pcre2grep-jit
</pre>
      </div>

      command.</p>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2build-3_sect8" name="pcre2build-3_sect8" shape="rect"> </a>
      <h2>NEWLINE RECOGNITION</h2>
      <p>By default, PCRE2 interprets the linefeed (LF) character
      as indicating the end of a line. This is the normal newline
      character on Unix-like systems. You can compile PCRE2 to use
      carriage return (CR) instead, by adding</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-newline-is-cr
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command.
      There is also an --enable-newline-is-lf option, which
      explicitly specifies linefeed as the newline character.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, you can specify that line endings are to be
      indicated by the two-character sequence CRLF (CR immediately
      followed by LF). If you want this, add</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-newline-is-crlf
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command.
      There is a fourth option, specified by</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-newline-is-anycrlf
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>which causes PCRE2 to recognize any of the three sequences
      CR, LF, or CRLF as indicating a line ending. A fifth option,
      specified by</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-newline-is-any
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>causes PCRE2 to recognize any Unicode newline sequence.
      The Unicode newline sequences are the three just mentioned,
      plus the single characters VT (vertical tab, U+000B), FF
      (form feed, U+000C), NEL (next line, U+0085), LS (line
      separator, U+2028), and PS (paragraph separator, U+2029). The
      final option is</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-newline-is-nul
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>which causes NUL (binary zero) to be set as the default
      line-ending character.</p>
      <p>Whatever default line ending convention is selected when
      PCRE2 is built can be overridden by applications that use the
      library. At build time it is recommended to use the standard
      for your operating system.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2build-3_sect9" name="pcre2build-3_sect9" shape="rect"> </a>
      <h2>WHAT \R MATCHES</h2>
      <p>By default, the sequence \R in a pattern matches any
      Unicode newline sequence, independently of what has been
      selected as the line ending sequence. If you specify</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-bsr-anycrlf
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>the default is changed so that \R matches only CR, LF, or
      CRLF. Whatever is selected when PCRE2 is built can be
      overridden by applications that use the library.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2build-3_sect10" name="pcre2build-3_sect10" shape="rect"> </a>
      <h2>HANDLING VERY LARGE PATTERNS</h2>
      <p>Within a compiled pattern, offset values are used to point
      from one part to another (for example, from an opening
      parenthesis to an alternation metacharacter). By default, in
      the 8-bit and 16-bit libraries, two-byte values are used for
      these offsets, leading to a maximum size for a compiled
      pattern of around 64 thousand code units. This is sufficient
      to handle all but the most gigantic patterns. Nevertheless,
      some people do want to process truly enormous patterns, so it
      is possible to compile PCRE2 to use three-byte or four-byte
      offsets by adding a setting such as</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--with-link-size=3
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command.
      The value given must be 2, 3, or 4. For the 16-bit library, a
      value of 3 is rounded up to 4. In these libraries, using
      longer offsets slows down the operation of PCRE2 because it
      has to load additional data when handling them. For the
      32-bit library the value is always 4 and cannot be
      overridden; the value of --with-link-size is ignored.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2build-3_sect11" name="pcre2build-3_sect11" shape="rect"> </a>
      <h2>LIMITING PCRE2 RESOURCE USAGE</h2>
      <p>The <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() function
      increments a counter each time it goes round its main loop.
      Putting a limit on this counter controls the amount of
      computing resource used by a single call to <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(). The limit can be changed at
      run time, as described in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2api.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2api</span>(3)</span></a> documentation.
      The default is 10 million, but this can be changed by adding
      a setting such as</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--with-match-limit=500000
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command.
      This setting also applies to the <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>() matching function, and to
      JIT matching (though the counting is done differently).</p>
      <p>The <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() function
      starts out using a 20KiB vector on the system stack to record
      backtracking points. The more nested backtracking points
      there are (that is, the deeper the search tree), the more
      memory is needed. If the initial vector is not large enough,
      heap memory is used, up to a certain limit, which is
      specified in kibibytes (units of 1024 bytes). The limit can
      be changed at run time, as described in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2api.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2api</span>(3)</span></a> documentation.
      The default limit (in effect unlimited) is 20 million. You
      can change this by a setting such as</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--with-heap-limit=500
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>which limits the amount of heap to 500 KiB. This limit
      applies only to interpretive matching in <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() and <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>(), which may also use the
      heap for internal workspace when processing complicated
      patterns. This limit does not apply when JIT (which has its
      own memory arrangements) is used.</p>
      <p>You can also explicitly limit the depth of nested
      backtracking in the <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() interpreter. This limit
      defaults to the value that is set for --with-match-limit. You
      can set a lower default limit by adding, for example,</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--with-match-limit_depth=10000
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command.
      This value can be overridden at run time. This depth limit
      indirectly limits the amount of heap memory that is used, but
      because the size of each backtracking "frame" depends on the
      number of capturing parentheses in a pattern, the amount of
      heap that is used before the limit is reached varies from
      pattern to pattern. This limit was more useful in versions
      before 10.30, where function recursion was used for
      backtracking.</p>
      <p>As well as applying to <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(), the depth limit also
      controls the depth of recursive function calls in
      <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>(). These are
      used for lookaround assertions, atomic groups, and recursion
      within patterns. The limit does not apply to JIT
      matching.</p>

      <h2>CREATING CHARACTER TABLES AT BUILD TIME</h2>
      <p>PCRE2 uses fixed tables for processing characters whose
      code points are less than 256. By default, PCRE2 is built
      with a set of tables that are distributed in the file
      <em class="replaceable"><code>src/pcre2_chartables.c.dist</code></em>.
      These tables are for ASCII codes only. If you add</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-rebuild-chartables
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command,
      the distributed tables are no longer used. Instead, a program
      called <code class="function">pcre2_dftables</code> is
      compiled and run. This outputs the source for new set of
      tables, created in the default locale of your C run-time
      system. This method of replacing the tables does not work if
      you are cross compiling, because <code class="function">pcre2_dftables</code> needs to be run on the local
      host and therefore not compiled with the cross compiler.</p>
      <p>If you need to create alternative tables when cross
      compiling, you will have to do so "by hand". There may also
      be other reasons for creating tables manually. To cause
      <code class="function">pcre2_dftables</code> to be built on
      the local host, run a normal compiling command, and then run
      the program with the output file as its argument, for
      example:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 cc src/pcre2_dftables.c -o pcre2_dftables
 ./pcre2_dftables src/pcre2_chartables.c
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>This builds the tables in the default locale of the local
      host. If you want to specify a locale, you must use the -L
      option:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
LC_ALL=fr_FR ./pcre2_dftables -L src/pcre2_chartables.c
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>You can also specify -b (with or without -L). This causes
      the tables to be written in binary instead of as source code.
      A set of binary tables can be loaded into memory by an
      application and passed to <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>() in the same way as tables
      created by calling <code class="function">pcre2_maketables</code>(). The tables are just a
      string of bytes, independent of hardware characteristics such
      as endianness. This means they can be bundled with an

      <h2>USING EBCDIC CODE</h2>
      <p>PCRE2 assumes by default that it will run in an
      environment where the character code is ASCII or Unicode,
      which is a superset of ASCII. This is the case for most
      computer operating systems. PCRE2 can, however, be compiled
      to run in an 8-bit EBCDIC environment by adding</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-ebcdic --disable-unicode
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command.
      This setting implies --enable-rebuild-chartables. You should
      only use it if you know that you are in an EBCDIC environment
      (for example, an IBM mainframe operating system).</p>
      <p>It is not possible to support both EBCDIC and UTF-8 codes
      in the same version of the library. Consequently,
      --enable-unicode and --enable-ebcdic are mutually
      exclusive.</p>
      <p>The EBCDIC character that corresponds to an ASCII LF is
      assumed to have the value 0x15 by default. However, in some
      EBCDIC environments, 0x25 is used. In such an environment you
      should use</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-ebcdic-nl25
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>as well as, or instead of, --enable-ebcdic. The EBCDIC
      character for CR has the same value as in ASCII, namely,
      0x0d. Whichever of 0x15 and 0x25 is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> chosen as LF is made to
      correspond to the Unicode NEL character (which, in Unicode,
      is 0x85).</p>
      <p>The options that select newline behaviour, such as
      --enable-newline-is-cr, and equivalent run-time options,
      refer to these character values in an EBCDIC environment.</p>

      <h2>PCRE2GREP SUPPORT FOR EXTERNAL SCRIPTS</h2>
      <p>By default <code class="function">pcre2grep</code>
      supports the use of callouts with string arguments within the
      patterns it is matching. There are two kinds: one that
      generates output using local code, and another that calls an
      external program or script. If
      --disable-pcre2grep-callout-fork is added to the <code class="function">configure</code> command, only the first kind of
      callout is supported; if --disable-pcre2grep-callout is used,
      all callouts are completely ignored. For more details of
      <code class="function">pcre2grep</code> callouts, see the
      <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2grep</span>(3)</span> documentation.</p>

      <h2>PCRE2GREP OPTIONS FOR COMPRESSED FILE SUPPORT</h2>
      <p>By default, <code class="function">pcre2grep</code> reads
      all files as plain text. You can build it so that it
      recognizes files whose names end in <em class="replaceable"><code>.gz</code></em> or <em class="replaceable"><code>.bz2</code></em>, and reads them with
      <code class="function">libz</code> or <code class="function">libbz2</code>, respectively, by adding one or both
      of</p>
      <div class="informalexample">

 --enable-pcre2grep-libz
 --enable-pcre2grep-libbz2
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command.
      These options naturally require that the relevant libraries
      are installed on your system. Configuration will fail if they
      are not.</p>

      <h2>PCRE2GREP BUFFER SIZE</h2>
      <p><code class="function">pcre2grep</code> uses an internal
      buffer to hold a "window" on the file it is scanning, in
      order to be able to output "before" and "after" lines when it
      finds a match. The default starting size of the buffer is
      20KiB. The buffer itself is three times this size, but
      because of the way it is used for holding "before" lines, the
      longest line that is guaranteed to be processable is the
      notional buffer size. If a longer line is encountered,
      <code class="function">pcre2grep</code> automatically expands
      the buffer, up to a specified maximum size, whose default is
      1MiB or the starting size, whichever is the larger. You can
      change the default parameter values by adding, for
      example,</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 --with-pcre2grep-bufsize=51200
 --with-pcre2grep-max-bufsize=2097152

      </div>
      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command.
      The caller of <code class="function">pcre2grep</code> can
      override these values by using --buffer-size and
      --max-buffer-size on the command line.</p>

      <h2>PCRE2TEST OPTION FOR LIBREADLINE SUPPORT</h2>
      <p>If you add one of</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 --enable-pcre2test-libreadline
 --enable-pcre2test-libedit
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command,
      <code class="function">pcre2test</code> is linked with the
      <code class="function">libreadline</code> or<code class="function">libedit</code> library, respectively, and when its
      input is from a terminal, it reads it using the <code class="function">readline</code>() function. This provides
      line-editing and history facilities. Note that <code class="function">libreadline</code> is GPL-licensed, so if you
      distribute a binary of <code class="function">pcre2test</code> linked in this way, there may be
      licensing issues. These can be avoided by linking instead
      with <code class="function">libedit</code>, which has a BSD
      licence.</p>
      <p>Setting --enable-pcre2test-libreadline causes the
      <code class="option">−lreadline</code> option to be
      added to the <code class="function">pcre2test</code> build.
      In many operating environments with a sytem-installed
      readline library this is sufficient. However, in some
      environments (e.g. if an unmodified distribution version of
      readline is in use), some extra configuration may be
      necessary. The INSTALL file for <code class="function">libreadline</code> says this:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 "Readline uses the termcap functions, but does not link with
 the termcap or curses library itself, allowing applications
 which link with readline the to choose an appropriate library."
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>If your environment has not been set up so that an
      appropriate library is automatically included, you may need
      to add something like</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
LIBS="-ncurses"

      <h2>CODE COVERAGE REPORTING</h2>
      <p>If your C compiler is gcc, you can build a version of
      PCRE2 that can generate a code coverage report for its test
      suite. To enable this, you must install <code class="function">lcov</code> version 1.6 or above. Then specify</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-coverage
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>to the <code class="function">configure</code> command and
      build PCRE2 in the usual way.</p>
      <p>Note that using <code class="function">ccache</code> (a
      caching C compiler) is incompatible with code coverage
      reporting. If you have configured <code class="function">ccache</code> to run automatically on your system,
      you must set the environment variable</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
CCACHE_DISABLE=1
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>before running <code class="function">make</code> to build
      PCRE2, so that <code class="function">ccache</code> is not
      used.</p>
      <p>When --enable-coverage is used, the following addition
      targets are added to the <code class="function">Makefile</code>:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
make coverage
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>This creates a fresh coverage report for the PCRE2 test
      suite. It is equivalent to running "make coverage-reset",
      "make coverage-baseline", "make check", and then "make
      coverage-report".</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
make coverage-reset
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>This zeroes the coverage counters, but does nothing
      else.</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
make coverage-baseline

      <h2>DISABLING THE Z AND T FORMATTING MODIFIERS</h2>
      <p>The C99 standard defines formatting modifiers z and t for
      size_t and ptrdiff_t values, respectively. By default, PCRE2
      uses these modifiers in environments other than Microsoft
      Visual Studio when __STDC_VERSION__ is defined and has a
      value greater than or equal to 199901L (indicating C99).
      However, there is at least one environment that claims to be
      C99 but does not support these modifiers. If</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--disable-percent-zt
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>is specified, no use is made of the z or t modifiers.
      Instead of %td or %zu, %lu is used, with a cast for size_t
      values.</p>

      <h2>SUPPORT FOR FUZZERS</h2>
      <p>There is a special option for use by people who want to
      run fuzzing tests on PCRE2:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-fuzz-support
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>At present this applies only to the 8-bit library. If set,
      it causes an extra library called libpcre2-fuzzsupport.a to
      be built, but not installed. This contains a single function
      called LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput() whose arguments are a pointer
      to a string and the length of the string. When called, this
      function tries to compile the string as a pattern, and if
      that succeeds, to match it. This is done both with no options
      and with some random options bits that are generated from the
      string.</p>
      <p>Setting --enable-fuzz-support also causes a binary called
      <code class="function">pcre2fuzzcheck</code> to be created.
      This is normally run under valgrind or used when PCRE2 is
      compiled with address sanitizing enabled. It calls the
      fuzzing function and outputs information about what it is
      doing. The input strings are specified by arguments: if an
      argument starts with "=" the rest of it is a literal input
      string. Otherwise, it is assumed to be a file name, and the
      contents of the file are the test string.</p>

      <h2>OBSOLETE OPTION</h2>
      <p>In versions of PCRE2 prior to 10.30, there were two ways
      of handling backtracking in the <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() function. The default was to
      use the system stack, but if</p>

--disable-stack-for-recursion
